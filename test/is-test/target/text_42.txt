"We were offered champagne, then they left the room"
Husband and wife Atli Bollason and Ásrún Magnúsdóttir agreed to an unusual request from artist Ragnar Kjartansson: to have sex in front of a camera for an exhibition that the artist was mounting in Paris.
"We loved each other so this was not complicated."
Atli Bollason never forgets meeting his wife and mother of his children, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.
"I became very infatuated with her.
There was her charisma, of course, but I also thought she was just incredibly cute.
And I still think so," he says.
Ásrún also remembers this, as her husband regularly reminisces about their first encounter.
"I'm always hearing this story.
The last time was just this weekend," says Ásrún, who was also attracted to her husband when they first met.
"I felt, and still feel, that there's so much excitement around Atli, which I like.
There's a lot going on and much happening and I was charmed by that."
Atli says that in their relationship, the couple have focused on going their own way.
"We don't tread the well-worn paths.
We avoid the routines that we can detect around us."
That may be why they simply welcomed artist Kjartan Ragnarsson's request, despite it being unusual, to put it mildly.
"Our mutual friend, Kristín Anna, contacted us to ask whether we could join her, Raggi and Ragnar's wife, Ingibjörg, for desserts at Snaps."
They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snaps and had dessert wine and one dessert each.
They listened to Ragnar, who talked them through his plans for the art exhibition that he intended to mount at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris that autumn.
"He had a multi-channel video installation called Scenes from Western Culture.
He described it in a simple manner."
According to Ásrún, he described the piece as banal and decadent scenes from the everyday life of Westerners.
"He had sketches of all the scenes that he intended to shoot and the last thing he told us about was the thing that he wanted to know whether we would be interested in taking part in."
The scene that Ragnar asked the couple to take part in was supposed to show a middle-class couple making love in a minimalistic room.
"It's intercourse with a beginning and end," says Atli.
The couple didn't know Ragnar well, although they were aware of him and he of them, "but they were familiar with us and felt that we were right for this.
They mentioned that they didn't want to advertise for people.
Maybe they thought that they wouldn't get the right people but rather people who receive sexual gratification from performing for others."
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about the matter, but that didn't take long.
"As we walked out of Snaps we said: Aren't we up for this?
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist, as well as his whole team," says Ásrún and Atli concurs.
"This is about the love and intimacy"
The scene was filmed in a fancy apartment at Mýrargata.
The crew was very small: a cameraman, Ragnar and a sound technician, and the couple.
When the recording had been turned on, everyone except Atli and Ásrún left the room to wait in a car outside.
"We hadn't decided anything about what we were going to be like.
We received some minor instructions, but we tried to forget the time and place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
There was no acting, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Ásrún.
But was it romantic?
"Yes, it was a little romantic," says Atli, and Ásrún agrees.
„We were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was a little like being on vacation at a fancy hotel in Paris."
The crew was pleased with the couple's performance in the piece, and it moved them.
"Tommi the cameraman cried when he watched it, he thought it was so beautiful," says Atli.
"It's as much about the love and intimacy as about the intercourse itself," says Ásrún.
The couple's parents have seen the piece, and Atli says that his mother heard her son's voice at the Reykjavik Art Museum and then realised that he was part of the piece.
"Then she turned around and began to examine it," says Atli.
"Mom and dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone about this, but then dad just sends me a message and says: It was fun to run into the little family in the Palais de Tokyo," Ásrún recalls.
And did taking part in the project deepen the relationship between Ásrún and Atli?
We're still together, anyway, so maybe it deepened something.
At least it deepened the relationship with my in-laws," says Ásrún with a laugh.
As for Ásrún, she saw the piece in Copenhagen with her colleague.
"I found it a little difficult to be with someone other than you," she says, turning to her husband.
"But it was fun to see it because it's just one scene in a much bigger piece and it's very impressive when you see it along with the other pieces.
I was able to detach myself a little from it, and I was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my belly," says Ásrún, who was pregnant with the couple's second child when the scene was shot.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked to Ásrún and Atli for Love Stories on Channel 1.
