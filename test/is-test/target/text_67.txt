Four out of five infections unrelated
Five domestic infections have been diagnosed in the country in recent days.
Four of these are completely unconnected and the origin of the infection that came up at the Rey Cup tournament yesterday, for instance, has not been found.
Infection tracing is still ongoing.
More than twenty individuals were originally quarantined but were later reduced to sixteen.
A total of 34 people are quarantined because of these new infections detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period that an infection is detected at a sporting event, which has raised questions of whether such events should be held.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, Communications Director of the Department of Civil Protection, says that it's completely possible as long as people comply with guidelines and rules.
"We are constantly reminding all who live here that individual disease prevention measures must be maintained.
We also have to remind people who are holding events that there are certain rules that must be observed.
That way we can hold events," says Jóhann.
He says that infections can be prevented by promoting individual disease prevention measures.
In addition to that, rules and guidelines are constantly being reexamined.
"What has to be done, and what the Department of Civil Protection and the Directorate of Health are constantly exhorting people to do, is to tend to these individual disease prevention measures.
Both at home and at service companies.
For people to wash their hands and use disinfectant.
That prevents infections from spreading," says Jóhann.
"We have to remind people to continue on the positive path we were on, in order to be able to maintain the results we have achieved up to this point."
