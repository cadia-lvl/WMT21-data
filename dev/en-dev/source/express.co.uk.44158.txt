Coronavirus row breaks out on bus as driver gets in fiery exchange over face masks
In the footage passengers and the driver onboard the Arriva bus service in Liverpool clash over the use of face masks.
The bus driver can be heard explaining to a woman that it is not his job to tell passengers to wear face masks.
The bus driver said: "It's not my job to ask everyone who comes on the bus about wearing a mask."
A witness said regarding the incident: "A man and an older woman started ganging up on her and a massive row erupted."
"The bus driver had to get out of his seat and came over to demand what was going on and he told one woman she wasn't even wearing her mask properly."
"That woman then stormed off the bus and said she was going to report the incident."
A spokesperson for Arriva said: "The safety of our customers and employees continues to be our priority.
"The wearing of face coverings continues to be mandatory for customers whilst using public transport (exemptions apply)."
"We have clear guidance and signage for customers in regards to this and all other social distancing measures in place on bus, via social media and our website."
It has been mandatory to wear a face covering when using public transport since June 15.
