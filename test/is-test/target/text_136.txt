Prepares to relocate more agencies outside the capital area
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs, declares that more government agencies will be relocated outside the capital area in the near future.
The Minister said this on the programme Sprengisandur on Bylgjan at noon today.
It was recently announced that the Fire Department of the Housing and Construction Authority will be relocated to Sauðárkrókur this autumn.
The Authority employs six fire safety experts, but none of them intend to move to the north of the country along with the Authority, and the National Association of Firefighters and Ambulance Workers has criticised the relocation.
"I think we should take further steps in this direction.
I'm preparing further steps in this direction.
More relocations," said Ásmundur.
He says he is convinced that a vast majority of the nation wants to see government agencies distributed more widely around the country.
"I think that there have to be more political decisions to relocate government jobs to rural areas, like I just did with the Housing and Construction Authority," said Ásmundur, who also named examples of other institutions that have been relocated outside the capital area and were of great importance to the rural communities, such as the relocation of the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority to Selfoss, the National Land Survey of Iceland to Akranes and the Unemployment Insurance Payment Office to Skagaströnd.
