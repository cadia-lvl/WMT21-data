Happiness in the hot tub
Is the secret to Icelanders' happiness found in the hot tubs?
BBC presenters suggest this in a fun video that sheds light on the swimming pool and hot tub culture of Icelanders.
The Icelandic bath culture is unique in the world, and it is claimed that there are nowhere as many bathing spots per capita.
The natural geothermal heat is the basis for this, as well as the local swimming tradition.
Swimming became a mandatory school subject for children in 1940, but senior citizens are just as likely to use the hot water to boost their health.
Trips to the swimming pool are described as a fixed part of Icelanders' general welfare.
In the hot tub, everyone is equal, regardless of their class or position.
Freed from their mobile phones, people can have personal conversations on any subject or enjoy the healing virtues of the water by meditating and recharging their mental and physical batteries.
