Tree Branches Downed as Hurricane Hanna Passes Through Southern Texas
Hurricane Hanna weakened to a tropical storm after it made landfall on the coast of southern Texas on Saturday, July 25, but officials warned the storm still had potential to lead to "life-threatening" flash flooding.
The National Weather Service (NWS) said heavy rainfall remained the greatest threat in southern Texas and northeastern Mexico as the storm moved west-southwest on Sunday.
Jorge Castillo shared this footage on Twitter, and told Storyful he filmed this footage outside his home in Combes, Texas, on Sunday morning.
