Home form vital for Jose Mourinho as boss says it will be easier for Tottenham when fans return to stadiums
Jose Mourinho has helped Tottenham Hotspur start a new unbeaten run at home since the Premier League's restart, but he says making that home form more consistent would be easier with supporters back.
Spurs have taken 12 wins from their home fixtures this term, but were beaten four times - only one of the six teams above them lost more on home soil.
The Portuguese coach says it's possible to build those important streaks while fans are absent, but would be easier with them present.
"We need to do it with the fans. Without them you can create a kind of fortress, but based on the tactical side of the game," he said.
"But, I think with fans, you can do it in a much stronger way because you add the emotional side of the game that only your fans in your stadium can give to you."
Mourinho feels that achieving the kind of long unbeaten streaks on home soil which he enjoyed at Chelsea, or which Liverpool have built over the past three seasons, is becoming ever tougher as the opposition becomes stronger.
But it's also a crucial factor in determining whether sides achieve their respective objectives at the end of the season, particularly in close-fought or derby matches where a home atmosphere can make the difference.
"I think the Premier League is getting into a direction where these unbeaten records are something more and more difficult to achieve because of the level of the teams."
"But to be strong at home and to arrive at the end of each season with an important number of points in your pocket from home matches is very important."
"I think our recent results at home without the fans are important, but we need them back.
I can imagine that victory against Arsenal with the stadium full of Tottenham fans.
This is the kind of empathy that you can create step by step."
