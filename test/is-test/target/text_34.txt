Sprengisandur: Discussion of the situation on the labour market, pension funds and much more
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children, will be a guest on Sprengisandur today at ten o'clock on Bylgjan.
He is also Labour Market Minister and will, as such, discuss the current labour market situation, the Icelandair issue and more.
He will also discuss the issues of rural areas and the relocation of jobs there, which has been unsuccessful and controversial in recent years and decades.
Another guest of the programme is VR Chairman Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, who will discuss his criticism of pension fund investments and present his proposals of the labour movement and employers withdrawing from pension fund boards to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
There will also be an interview with Ívar Ingimarsson, tourism operator in East Iceland, and Árnheiður Jóhannsdóttir, managing director of Visit North Iceland, about the state of tourism in rural Iceland.
They will look ahead, towards the coming autumn, and consider whether the success this summer is a misleading indicator of what lies ahead.
You can listen to the programme, which starts at ten, below.
