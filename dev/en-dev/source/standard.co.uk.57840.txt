Pedro Chelsea exit confirmed as team-mates 'serenade' forward in changing room send-off
Chelsea boss Frank Lampard has paid tribute to winger Pedro Rodriguez after making his final league appearance for the club on Sunday.
The 32-year-old penned a short-term extension to his contract to see out the season with the club but will join AS Roma on a free transfer upon the conclusion of the campaign.
The Spain international, who arrived from Barcelona back in 2015, has played a bit-part role under Lampard this season with only eight Premier League starts and 21 appearances in all competitions.
The Blues boss confirmed Pedro's departure after the west London club sealed a top-four finish with a 2-0 win over Wolves, with the veteran coming off the bench for his final appearance.
"Pedro has played his last game for the club," Lampard told Sky Sports.
"The lads have just pretty much serenaded him in the changing room and rightly so because of the career he has had generally and for this club.
"It was his last Premier League game, but the impact he has had here is huge.
I want to say a big thanks to Peds and wish him well as he goes forward.
"He is here for the remainder of games, but a big player of the club leaves and the spirit of the club I saw afterwards was pretty special."
Pedro tweeted a farewell message after the game via his Twitter account, writing: "My last game at Stamford Bridge.
Thanks to every fan for your support through these years, to the club for giving me the chance of being a Blue and to my team-mates.
You'll be in my heart forever.
Now let's fight for the FA Cup trophy!!!
BIG BLUE FAMILY."
The former Barcelona forward leaves after helping Chelsea since the title in 2017 under Antonio Conte and also won the FA Cup in 2018, as well as the Europa League a year later under Maurizio Sarri.
