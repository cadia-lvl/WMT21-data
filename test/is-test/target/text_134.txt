A new strain rather than a new type of virus
"A new virus just means that this was an individual who arrived from abroad.
This is not something that has been brewing in this country," says Már Kristjánsson, head doctor at Landspitali Hospital's communicable disease ward, about the news of a "new type of virus" being detected in this country.
Three domestic infections were diagnosed yesterday and two at the border.
One of those diagnosed had participated in sports club activities at the Rey Cup football tournament but the source of the infection has not been found and the infection is currently being traced.
An infection was also detected in an individual who arrived in the country on 15 July, and two persons who were in contact with this individual are beginning to show symptoms of COVID—19.
Yesterday, an infection connected to an infection reported the day before yesterday was also diagnosed, and sequence analysis by deCODE Genetics showed a "new type of virus that has not been diagnosed here before."
Tracing in connection with that infection has been completed.
Már notes that this is not a new virus but the same virus that has spread across the world, i.e. the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It would be more accurate to talk about a new strain of that virus rather than a new type of virus.
When asked what this means and whether this could indicate anything about a new wave of the pandemic having begun, Már says that this is an isolated incident at the moment and it was possible that nothing more would come of it.
"However, if there are more domestic cases with no overseas connections and the same genotype as this particular strain, the conclusion could be made [about a second wave] but it is not timely at this point," Már explains.
