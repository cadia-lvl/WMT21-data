Pension funds and long shadows
2019 was a major anniversary year in the history of Icelandic pension funds.
Public officials had in fact received a pension from the King of Denmark ever since the 19th century, but 1919 saw the founding of a pension fund for public officials, which eventually became a pension fund for all public-sector employees.
The foundations for the present-day pension funds for general wage earners were laid with the collective wage agreements on the labour market in 1969, which provided for fully funded mandatory occupational pension funds from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were established on the basis of these agreements, after which the pension fund system continued to strengthen.
A pension fund system for wage earners was not the only radical change that the 20th century labour movement enforced through its fight for improved employment conditions.
Unemployment insurance had been secured by similar means in the historic strike of 1955, and the movement gradually also achieved its demands for sickness rights and sickness funds, significant vacation rights, reduced working hours, improved housing and other such important matters.
All these rights were the result of a long and difficult struggle but proved, in retrospect, to be a much more significant and permanent improvement of employment terms than adding a few coins to the pay envelope, which were immediately lost to the inflation that characterised the post-war period until 1990, as many will remember.
The backstory to the founding of general pension funds in 1969 is both long and complex.
Although it was eventually agreed that the funds would in fact be owned by the fund members, the labour movement had to agree to the boards of the funds being composed of an equal number of representatives of employers and fund members.
In the years following the establishment of the funds, the demand for a majority of workers on the boards of the funds was often discussed in employees' organisations but never became an actuality, so we are still stuck with the unnatural arrangement of fund member representatives not being in the majority on the boards of the funds.
Article 36 of Act no. 129/1997 on Mandatory Pension Insurance and on the Activities of Pension Funds pertains to the investment policy of the funds.
According to Item 1, "a pension fund must be guided by the interests of fund members".
Item 5 furthermore reads: "A pension fund must establish ethical criteria for its investments."
The shareholder policy of the Pension Fund of Commerce includes the following provisions, following the aforementioned legal provisions:
The Pension Fund is a signatory of the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), as are many of the largest pension funds and institutional investors in North America and Europe.
These principles discuss how emphasis on social and environmental issues, together with good corporate governance, can improve returns on investment portfolios.
In this manner the interests of investors and the objectives of society in a broader perspective go hand in hand.
LV considers it important for companies, especially those publicly listed on an equity market, to adopt official policies on practising good corporate governance, remuneration, social responsibility and environment issues.
Gildi Pension Fund, which is among Iceland's biggest funds, has established a "policy on responsible investments" which includes provisions of a similar nature.
All this is recollected here as an introduction to the latest buzz word in Icelandic, "shadow direction".
As the word is a new one in the language, it has understandably not been fully defined, but it seems to me like the following definition is currently the "most popular pick": Shadow direction is when a trade union leader proclaims in the media that they will give the union's representatives on the board of a pension fund recommendations or instructions on what position to take on a particular matter.
Failure to follow the recommendation would result in dismissal from the board at the first opportunity.
However, this is not "shadow direction" if the leader does not take this to the media or talk about dismissal, as such communications between people are of course common in the financial world, like elsewhere.
I leave it to the reader to decide which method is more "shadowy".
At the time of writing, on the morning of Saturday, 25 July 2019, there are mainly two men who have tried to shape this definition.
They are Hörður Ægisson, reporter at Fréttablaðið, and Central Bank Governor Ásgeir Jónsson.
For both of them, the motive arose when Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had told of his intention to terminate the company's agreements with airline hostesses and flight attendants (dismiss them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, Chairman of VR, recommended that the union's representatives on the board of the Pension Fund of Commerce refrained from supporting any purchase of the company's shares by the fund, or else they may be made to step down.
Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision and Ragnar Þór subsequently did the same with his recommendation, which was of course based on Bogi's decision.
Hörður and Ásgeir nevertheless saw reason to expound on the matter in Fréttablaðið's Friday edition, using big words on shadow direction, illegal acts and the urgent need for legal amendments.
This was truly a molehill that was to be made into a mountain, even though the molehill in question was conditional as well as being quickly removed.
Finally, let's consider the subject itself, as it is an important one.
Above, I noted the provisions of the Pension Fund Act that pertain to this issue.
They say that the boards of pension funds are obliged to protect the interests of fund members and have ethical investment criteria, and these provisions are further elaborated in the Articles of Association of both Gildi and the Pension Fund of Commerce, as I have noted.
On the other hand, pension fund are NOT supposed to only consider short-term profitability in their investments.
In fact, such a policy would be very dangerous, and one would not have to look long for such examples in the past, where big loans from banks and funds have gone to unethical speculators and environmental polluters, with terrible consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on thin ice when he got the idea to wipe out an entire group of employees, thus significantly reducing the goodwill that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Fortunately, he reconsidered and reversed this.
Time will tell whether that will be enough, when all is said and done, for pension fund investment in the company to be considered responsible towards the fund members.
