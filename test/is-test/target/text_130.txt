No ambassador for five years since 2009
The US ambassador to Iceland, Jeffrey Gunter Ross, is the focus of media attention following CBS's report this morning that he requested an armed bodyguard because he feared for his life.
It has not been an easy task for the US President to appoint an ambassador to this country, however.
Since Carol Van Voorst left the office of US ambassador in late April 2009, Iceland has been without an ambassador for a total of 62 months, or over five years.
Van Voorst left office under peculiar circumstances, with Kastljós reporting in 2009 that she was supposed to receive the Order of the Falcon.
While on her way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a telephone call from the President's office to tell her that she wouldn't be awarded the honour.
After leaving Iceland, she taught international communications at the Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor arrived in September 2010.
This may be have been due in part to Robert S. Connan being previously appointed ambassador but then changing his mind.
Finally, Loius Ariega, who had worked in the foreign service for decades, took on the job.
He stepped down in the autumn of 2013 to assume the office of ambassador to Guatemala.
There was subsequently another ambassador-less period.
In January 2015, the United States Senate approved the appointment of Robert Barber, who arrived shortly thereafter, by which time there had been no ambassador for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed rather than a diplomat, having worked as a lawyer and contributed to Barack Obama's election fund.
He stepped down as soon as Donald Trump assumed the office of President on 20 January 2017, as is the custom with politically appointed ambassadors.
The Trump administration took unusually long to appoint both ambassadors and high-ranking officials in Washington.
Two years passed until the United States Senate summoned Jeffrey Ross Gunter to question him thoroughly before confirming his appointment as ambassador to Iceland.
In his Senate hearing, he said that he had never been to Iceland but had frequently been to Western Europe, as his late wife had been of Dutch descent.
Gunter is a political appointee who was previously a dermatologist in California and has been active in the organisation of Jews in the Republican Party, the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The organisation was founded by casino owner Sheldon Adelson, who is a fervent supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter arrived to assume office in Iceland in May 2019, by which time there had been no ambassador in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is a record length of time in this country.
The reason is both the long time it took for the Trump administration to appoint people to key offices and the great delays in the work of the Senate in recent years, including in the confirmation of ambassadors.
Since 2009, Iceland has therefore been without an ambassador for a total of over five years.
This has not prevented construction projects by the embassy, which recently opened new headquarters at Engjateigur.
The construction is believed to have cost about ISK 6.5 billion, with enormously thick security walls surrounding the building and bulletproof glass in all windows.
This does not seem to be enough to give the current ambassador a sense of security, however, as he is said to fear for his life and has requested an armed body guard.
