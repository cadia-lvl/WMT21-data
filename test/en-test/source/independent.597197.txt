Leicester happy to hit target of European football says Golden Boot winner Jamie Vardy
Jamie Vardy acknowledged his disappointment at missing out on Champions League football, but said Leicester City achieved their early-season objective of qualifying for Europe.
The Foxes were second in December and third when football restarted after lockdown, but they took just four points from their last five games to finish fifth in the Premier League.
A final-day win over Manchester United would have secured a top-four finish, but Brendan Rodgers" side suffered a 2-0 loss, which Vardy says was the most upsetting aspect.
"It was disappointing, more the way we've ended up losing the game," he said on Sky Sports at full-time.
"But we've said in the dressing room, we targeted behind closed doors to qualify for Europe and we've done that."
"We had the chance to qualify for the Champions League and that was even better, but we'll reflect on it and come back stronger next year."
"It's hard to take, but our main target was Europe and we've managed to do that."
While his team fell short, Vardy himself ended the season as the Premier League's top scorer at 33 years of age, scoring 23 times.
He paid tribute to his team-mates in receiving the award and said there are still plenty of miles left in him at the top level, despite his advancing age.
"I'm delighted, it's all about the team. I wouldn't have been in the position I was for the goals without them and I've put quite a few away."
"I'll have a rest for a bit now and come back for next season ready to go. Fortunately I don't feel my age, my legs are still fine and touch wood I don't pick up many injuries, so it's about keeping on top of that and come back as strong as I can next year."
