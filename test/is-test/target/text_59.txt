Will the Olympic flame be the light at the end of the tunnel?
When the final decision had been taken to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that only world wars had disrupted until then, the President of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic flame would be the "light at the end of the tunnel", presumably referring to the coronavirus pandemic through which the world is now jointly navigating.
Elite athletes have one more year to prepare themselves and Japanese authorities take on extra costs because of the postponement.
But all keep their chin up, as there is much at stake.
When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan, would be the site of this year's Olympics, the celebrations of the Japanese delegates were genuine.
They cried and laughed in turns, Tokyo having applied to host the 2016 games but losing out Rio, Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan would revel in the global spotlight.
The Olympics were supposed to be held on 24 July to 9 August, but have now been postponed for a year so they will instead begin on 23 July 2021 and end on 8 August.
If the games cannot be held then, if the coronavirus will still be too much of a threat, the games will be cancelled.
But this is something that no one really wants to contemplate.
The Olympic Games are no ordinary sporting competition.
No expense is spared, the spectacle is always supposed to be dazzling and top the previous games.
The selection of a host city for the Olympics is based on how an evaluation commission rates the cities' presentations.
The more spectacular the presentation — the more likely it is to be awarded.
Tokyo spent USD 150 million on its bid to host the 2016 Olympics, or the equivalent of over ISK 20 billion.
In the second instance, in the application for the 2020 games, USD 75 million, about ISK 10 billion, was spent on the promotion.
In 2013, when it was decided that Toyko would be awarded this year's games, Japanese authorities had therefore already spent the equivalent of ISK 30 billion on the project.
But this amount is only a drop in the ocean compared to the cost of building an Olympic village and stadiums, and the general cost of strengthening the country's infrastructures in order to be able to manage such a tournament, preparing for it and holding the games themselves.
The Japanese organisers have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to be taking place now but have been postponed for a year because of the coronavirus, would have cost USD 12.6 billion.
However, a report by the Japanese Board of Audit, published at the end of last year, revealed that the actual cost was closer to double that figure.
It's probably not possible to fully assess the cost of postponing the games but according to estimates, the cost may be from two to six billion dollars, in addition to the original cost.
The full cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese tax payers could therefore range from 15 to 30 billion dollars.
These numbers are so high that all of the Icelandic State's tax income would only cover just under half the Olympics, assuming the lowest possible cost.
The Olympic Games are an event of such magnitude that they have often been the subject of economists who attempt to review the figures and study the benefits and gains from the games.
In short, quite a number of people seem to have concluded that the effects of the Olympics are anything but positive for the economy of the host cities.
There are some short-term effects, including a great short-term increase in jobs, but in the longer term, cites are often left with a trail of debts and enormous operating costs for little-used facilities.
Rio, Brazil, is left with significant debts from the 2016 games and has had trouble funding the maintenance of all the large sports facilities that were built for the games.
A study of the figures from the 2012 games in London has shown that only 10 percent of those who got a job related to the Olympic games in the city were unemployed before.
This means that new jobs weren't created except to a limited extent.
In general, cities have not been particularly economically successful in hosting the Olympics because of the onerous costs related to the structures built for the games.
On the other hand, many believe there to be a benefit in the increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities after the games, although this is highly uncertain when it comes to the 2021 games.
It is also unclear whether it's possible to receive the large number of spectators who usually attend the games.
Most important, however, is the honour accorded to the cities in being selected, which is difficult to assess in terms of money.
The fact is that despite the enormous costs, it could also be said that the joy created by the games is of such a nature that it's impossible to put a price tag on it.
But although the spectacle is often impressive and no expense is spared, money is of course not the only issue.
The sports stars are at the forefront.
For some elite athletes, postponing the games is an accidental blessing.
One of these is Australian pentathlon competitor and gold medallist at the last Olympics, Chloe Esposito, who is heavily pregnant and would have been absent this summer but is hoping to be in competitive shape for the 2021 games.
That is why she is one of the athletes who are rather pleased with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For the athletes who intended to retire after this year's games, had they been held at the right time, the postponement of the games means, in some instances, that they will retire from competition before the games are held.
They simply do not trust their body to withstand another year of hard training.
Few athletes were as successful in securing their place in the hearts of spectators at the 2016 Olympics in Rio as the gymnastics star Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold medals around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has sat down for several interviews in her home country of the United States to discuss the Olympic Games.
She intends to go to the 2021 games but is not certain that she will still be at her peak at the games next year, when she will be 24 years old.
Although that is generally not considered old, it is rather much for a top-flight gymnast.
"This is a delicate subject" says Biles with a slight smile in an interview on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page when asked whether she intends to be as successful at the 2021 games as she was in Rio in 2016.
"I simply don't know whether I'll still be at the top after another whole year of training," says Biles.
She has previously said that her body will not stand the strain of gymnastic training much longer.
She is nevertheless training enthusiastically for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to stop training all of a sudden when the gymnasium was closed at the height of the pandemic.
Just as with everyone else, there were no exemptions for Biles while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gold medals could not buy her any priority access and like others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape.
The basic form is certainly a little better than for most people.
"We have a strict schedule now.
It was hard to begin training again when the gymnasium first opened again.
We began slowly but have reached full speed again and I will gradually add to the training as the year goes on.
Obviously, we don't know for sure how these games will be, or whether they will be held, but we can't do anything but train as if they will take place.
I have put in too much effort to leave the sport now," says Biles.
She, like others, has some doubts, or perhaps rather awareness of the possibility of the games not being held in 2021 either.
But trying to make predictions about this is hopeless.
No one can know what the status of the coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021 and there is nothing to do but prepare for the Olympics assuming that they will be held in a year.
Perhaps the Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel.
