Solskjær: Not the match that will define our season
Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær does not want to make too much of the importance of today's match against Leicester in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United loses, and Chelsea does not lose against the Wolves, Solskjær and his men will end up in fifth place, thus losing their Champions League spot.
They would still have some hope of reaching the Champions League, however, by winning the Europa League next month.
"We have not reached the end point.
If we pick up a point against Leicester, I think people will say that we did not have such a bad season," said Solskjær.
"But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we are still some way off from catching the two teams above us," said Solskjær.
it is obvious that people will be on edge at three o'clock today, but Solskjær tried to pretend that this was like any other match.
"If you want to be a part of Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and this is what the club is based on.
We have created an excellent opportunity to end the season on a high and now it's up to us to use it," said Solskjær.
"It's not the most important match of the season, it's just the next match.
You can ask anyone in football, the next match is always the most important.
Results don't define our season, we have already had many moments that define this season."
"The arrival of Bruno Fernandes changed a lot for us and I think that on the whole, we are in better form and much stronger mentally than last season," said Solskjær.
