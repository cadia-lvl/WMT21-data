Brynjólfur creates a stir: "This man understands what football is all about"
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been the subject of much talk, but also admiration for his conduct this season with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max League.
Breiðablik will be in the line of fire tonight, when they host ÍA in a match broadcast live on Stöð 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur will be banned from playing, due to his four yellow cards during the season, so he won't arrive for the match with a new haircut, like he has done until now at this summer's matches.
He had "bla, bla, bla" written on his head for the match against HK last Thursday, which HK won, 1-0.
"I don't know exactly who he was answering with that haircut, but speaking of character, this one was certainly making an effort during the match.
He didn't hide.
He wants the ball every single time, and if someone was going to score an equalizer in this game, I thought that he would do it or do it or create it," said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max Discussion when the talk turned to Brynjólfur.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
"It's sometimes difficult to see what position he's playing.
He tends to go a little to the left as the games progress, but he has a very free role within the team," said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Þorkell Máni Pétursson says that Brynjólfur is a real entertainer and is glad to see such a colourful man in the league: "No one disputes that he's a character.
He's a fun type and I love the thing about the hair and always being prepared to show up and answer for himself in interviews.
Incredibly many people are preoccupied by him, which tells me that this man understands what football is about.
"I'm an entertainer.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it."
People are reading interviews with Brynjólfur, paying admission and waiting to see what his hair will say next.
This man is simply a genius," said Máni.
