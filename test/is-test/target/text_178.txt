Swansea wins the first playoff semifinal
Swansea defeated Brentford, 1—0, in a dramatic encounter.
This was the teams' first of two playoff semifinals to reach the Premier League.
The match was played on Swansea's home ground in Wales.
The score at half time was 0–0.
The Swansea locals were awarded a penalty in the 64th minute but Andre Ayew failed to put his penalty kick past the goalkeeper.
Just two minutes later, Brentford player Rico Henry received the red card.
Brentford was therefore a man down for the remainder of the match and in the 82nd minute, the Swansea players used their advantage.
Andre Ayew made up for his failed penalty by scoring an excellent goal and securing a 1–0 victory for Swansea.
Swansea therefore has a 1–0 lead in the playoff semifinals with the second match taking place next Wednesday on Brentford's home ground.
