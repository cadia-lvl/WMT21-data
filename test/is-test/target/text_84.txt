KR player says he wants to leave the club - "I have been in contact with several B-division teams"
Tobias Thomsen, who plays with KR in the Pepsi Max League, seems to be leaving the team.
According to Danish news outlet Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Fótbolti.net also reported this.
Tobias wants to catch the start of the season in his home country but in order to do that, he must first terminate his contract with KR, as the Danish league begins before the Icelandic league concludes.
The club knows that I miss Denmark and has been very understanding with me," said Tobias in an interview with Bold.
I have been in contact with several B-division teams and will probably make the switch before the end of the Icelandic season.
Not many teams in Denmark can afford to buy up my contract with KR."
He adds that he will probably have to take a pay cut in Denmark.
"Danish clubs have probably felt more economic effects from the virus than Icelandic ones."
