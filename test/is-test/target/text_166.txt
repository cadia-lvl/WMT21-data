Flowers can be put on almost anything
It has a positive impact on children's development to be able to play in the garden with their parents, plant flowers and watch them grow.
As the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out, flowers also offer endless possibilities.
Just spending time with the children in the garden is something that is never forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the smell and of course the precious time they could spend with their parents.
