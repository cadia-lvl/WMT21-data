Police and protesters clash in Seattle
City authorities in Seattle have declared a state of riot following the large protests in the city centre.
Yesterday, the police used stun grenades and pepper spray to attempt to evacuate the large area occupied by protesters, which spread across numerous city blocks close to City Hall.
The police announced on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway on the damage done to a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of an explosive.
City and police authorities say that protesters threw rocks, bottles, firecrackers and other loose objects at the police, and one policeman was transferred to a hospital where his wounds were treated.
For a long time up until that point, however, the Seattle protests had been peaceful.
The protests were held as an act of solidarity with protesters in Portland, Oregon, where there have been repeated violent conflicts between protesters and heavily armed troops of FBI agents.
There, like in many other US cities, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, commemorate George Floyd, who was killed by a Minneapolis policeman on 25 May, protest systematic racism in American society and demand reforms.
