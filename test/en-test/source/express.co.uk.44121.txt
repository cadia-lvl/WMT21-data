Labour anti-Semitism whistleblowers demand Corbyn be expelled or face lawsuit
Labour could have to pay damages of between £3million and £8million, according to reports.
Now leader Keir Starmer is under pressure to expel Mr Corbyn.
Last night ex-party staff said they would drop the legal action if Mr Corbyn was ejected from the party.
The Labour Party has so far declined to comment on the demand.
However, Labour MP Jon Trickett said: "It is a ridiculous demand."
Supporters of Mr Corbyn said Mr Starmer needs to focus on tackling the Tories handling on coronavirus instead of delving back into Labour's internal divisions.
An ex-Labour Party source told the Daily Mail they would take legal action even if Mr Starmer did expel Mr Corbyn.
"I mean he's really, he's made the Labour party competitive again."
"There is still a long way to go on policy but he's made a really impressive start and he's got to a situation where for a lot of people who had really given up on the Labour party, voters as it were, I think they are now looking at it again much more sympathetically and they regard him as a serious figure."
Mr Blair did have concerns Labour is still seen as the party that raises taxes.
He said: "My experience with tax when you're in the Labour Party is be really careful because the public out there aren't sitting there worried as to whether you are going to raise taxes or not, they are probably worried that you are going to raise taxes so you've just got to be mindful of that concern."
