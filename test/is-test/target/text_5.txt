This is what she looks like now, 25 years later
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in various teenage series.
She became world-famous, however, with her performance as Amber in the film Clueless, 25 years ago.
She also appeared in the series Sabrina: The Teenage Witch along with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old and married, with one child.
Although she has stayed out of the limelight in recent years, she agreed to look back and talk about Clueless in an Australian television interview.
She recalls Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009, with fondness and says that she was a wonderful human being.
"I have to admit that I based the character mostly on girls that I knew in school and who weren't nice to me.
As soon as I read the script, I know who this person was," says Donovan about her Clueless performance.
