Donald Trump admits he often regrets his Twitter rants
Donald Trump has admitted he frequently regrets the incendiary posts he makes on Twitter.
Speaking to Barstool Sports Friday, the President of the United States admitted that his unchecked retweets - which have included pro-white supremacist material - get him in the most trouble.
Asked by journalist Dave Portnoy if he regretted his posts, Trump answered: "Often, too often.
It used to be in the old days before this, you'd write a letter and you'd say this letter is very big.
You put it on your desk and then you go back tomorrow and you say, "Oh, I'm glad I didn't send it," right?
But we don't do that with Twitter, right?
We put it out instantaneously, we feel great, and then you start getting phone calls - "Did you really say this?"
I say, "What's wrong with that?" and you find out a lot of things."
Last month, Trump sparked fury after retweeting (sharing content from another account) a video of his supporters in The Villages area of Florida, with the elderly pair filmed exclaiming "White power!"
And in 2017, Trump retweeted three anti-Muslim tweets posted by Jayda Fransen, leader of far-right fringe political party Britain First.

Trump said: "You see something that looks good and you don't investigate it and you don't know what's on the helmet exactly, right, which is a miniature and you don't blow it up, it sometimes - I have found that almost always it's the retweets that get you in trouble."
The president often shares praise for himself, rants about his rivals and conspiracy theories with his 80 million Twitter followers.
Trump says Twitter helps him cut through so-called "fake news" reports on TV shows and newspapers he claims are riddled with falsehoods.
But the president's own lies have frequently come under the microscope, with Twitter now flagging up Trump tweets that are inaccurate.
