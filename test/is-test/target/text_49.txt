Will not be fined for ISK 27 million Bitcoin harvesting
The State Internal Revenue Board has rejected a claim from the Director of Tax Investigations demanding that a man be fined for underreporting capital income from sales of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
The Board concludes that the Director of Tax Investigations has not provided clear arguments for the necessity of fining the man.
According to the Board's ruling, the Director of Tax Investigations believed that the man had filed materially false tax statements for the income years of 2016 and 2017.
He was said to have underreported financial income from sales of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin amounting to ISK 27 million, either intentionally or due to gross negligence.
The man should consequently be fined for his conduct.
The man rejected this in a letter to the Board.
He did, however, admit to selling cryptocurrency for ISK 27 million in 2016.
He said that he acquired this cryptocurrency through mining in the years 2009 and 2010, at a time when this could be done both easily and inexpensively with an ordinary home computer.
He also pointed out that when he sold the cryptocurrency, the administration of taxes for such sales was highly ambiguous and unpredictable.
Members of the general public could hardly have been expected to be aware of such arrangements in their tax statement.
He said that he did not intend to avoid paying taxes on his harvesting and that he had reported his asset in the statement as a deposit in a currency account.
He had asked both experts and the Directorate of Internal Revenue about the arrangement for this but to no avail.
He furthermore believed that the fact that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland, and had only lived here for a few years when he began mining for Bitcoin, must be taken into account.
That meant that he was in a worse position than others to familiarise himself with complex rules on which the tax authorities had not formed a clear opinion.
The man therefore considered it appropriate for his taxes for these two income years to be reassessed and a surcharge applied, but that no other penalties should be imposed.
He reiterated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes in this country since 2012.
He had never intended to shirk his responsibilities by improper means.
The fine that was demanded was completely out of proportion and would plunge him into debt.
