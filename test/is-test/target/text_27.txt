A whole apartment building rotting away in the best part of town
Romanian workers live for free at Dunhagi 18-20.
Meanwhile, the owners want a construction licence to make renovations, but their request has been stuck in the system for more than two years.
In one of Reykjavik's oldest, most established and most expensive neighbourhoods stands a stately three-storey apartment building.
The ground floor has approximately 600 square metres of commercial space.
The backside of the building has two doors to stairwells, each of which provides access to four rather grand apartments.
They range in size from 93 to 130 square metres, although most of them are over 100.
The building has a considerable history.
It was built in 1959 and former activities there include a video rental shop, shoemaker, milk shop, gunsmith, fishmonger and, most recently, University Printing.
The house has seen better days, to put it mildly.
The building is now subject to extensive damage, as can be seen in the accompanying photos.
The house is owned by D18 ehf.
According to the Company Register, D18 ehf.'s owners include Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús was at the forefront of Borgun's group of owners and was the spokesman for the holding company Borgun.
Among the owners of the holding company Borgun is Stálskip ehf.
Stálskip ehf. is the investment company of Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrún also owns a one-third share of D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once operated the fishing enterprise Stálskip.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and little or no maintenance work has been done on it since then.
Neighbours say that since then, the condition of the building has deteriorated steadily, but mostly in recent years.
On a Facebook page for residents of the neighbourhood, one resident says that the house has "not been particularly lively in the last few years."
The fact that the owners have, for several years, sought to alter the building and the lot may play a part in this.
Other neighbours say that the building has not been in acceptable condition for a long time.
The time has long come to do something proper with this spot, and its unfortunate that there has been such a delay."
He also says that he is ticked off at the owners of the building for not having made the effort to complete this thing, to find some common ground with the neighbours of the building and stop this "legal back-and-forth".
"Just do it in consultation with the surrounding community so this can be done quickly and completed."
The "legal back-and-forth" that the neighbour refers to is the planning process for the lot, which has been ongoing since at least 2017.
That was when the owners of Dunhagi 18 and 20 sought permission to add a storey to the current apartment building and build, behind the building, a new elevator shaft and single-storey annex, as well as a basement.
The construction licence issued for this project was appealed to the Ruling Committee on the Environment and Natural Resources, which cancelled the licence as the construction project did not have a basis in the land use plan and the hearing notification procedure was not satisfactory.
The City of Reykjavik then commenced land-use planning work, which concluded with a notice in the Government Gazette in July of last year.
That plan was also appealed and the Commission invalidated it in March of 2020.
At this point, almost three years had passed from the original application for a construction licence, and the owners of the building were back on square one.
The building had deteriorated considerably during that time, and the neighbours were getting weary.
When DV asked the neighbours about the condition of the building and their response, the answers were varied.
Some could understand the intentions of the owners of the house, others not at all.
Some directed their anger towards city authorities, others did not.
Others were just angry. not necessarily with anyone in particular.
Then there were those who said that the parking spaces were a cause of contention, as neighbours have used the unused parking spaces at Dunhagi 18-20 for their own vehicles.
One complainant in the matter said that they were long tired of the administrative system:
"It's incredible that we would have to go through the process three times.
It's like the City of Reykjavik can't read."
Today, the house is empty, abandoned and neglected.
A testament to cumbersome city administration and the noble intentions of the owners and their many years of work, which is now back on square one.
This reporter was met with wide open doors and piles of garbage upon arrival at Dunhagi 18.
A Playstation console and a newish television lay surrounded by other waste on the floor — victims of Icelandic summer precipitation.
The doors to the old University Print office was open and there was quite a lot of cats there, judging from the smell of urine.
Someone has obviously made a spot for themselves in one of the corners, but no one can be seen.
There were stacks of sofas and beds and a few pallets of pages on geology, which were undoubtedly intended to become a book.
The stairwells of the apartment building were also open and there were signs of life in both of them.
The reporter was so lucky as to meet the residents of one.
They were Romanians who were boiling a potato dish for dinner and invited the journalist to step inside.
The Romanians work for the temporary agency Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and according to DV's sources, the company has not paid anything for the housing except heat and electricity.
It is not considered acceptable to collect rent, due to the condition of the building.
Judging from the stacks of mail in the lobby, it is obvious that a number of foreign workers have lived there recently.
The operations of temporary agencies have not been unaffected by the Covid-19 situation, as the recession in tourism has resulted in a recession in the construction industry, and these two industries have been among the ones that have made the most use of the services of temporary agencies.
The residents of Dunhagi 18 nevertheless seemed to have plenty to do, and their work overalls and gloves were hanging to dry in the communal area after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the awful state of the building, the apartment shared by the boys seemed to be decently maintained.
When the journalist said goodbye to the Romanian boys, he became suddenly aware of the irony: In a prime spot in Reykjavik stands a 1,500 square metre property in disrepair.
The owners want to change and improve the building and the neighbours want the situation to improve but they disagree on the definition of "improvement".
Caught in between is the City's planning department, back on square one, the victim of endless means of appeals and complaints in the planning process and the Ruling Committee on the Environment and Natural Resources' sluggishness in providing a solution.
And the building is home to Romanian workers, who are perhaps exactly the ones who will go on to improve the situation, once the Icelanders stop squabbling.
