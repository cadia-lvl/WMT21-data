Patreksfjörður says campsite is fully booked on bank holiday weekend - directs visitors elsewhere
The campsite in Patreksfjörður is fully booked for the weekend, according to a notification from Vesturbyggð.
Visitors are advised to consider other accommodation options.
Vesturbyggð names Bíldudalur, Tálknafjörður, Melanes at Rauðasandur, Hótel Flókalundur and Hótel Breiðavík as other potential choices.
There is plenty going on in Patreksfjörður during this weekend as like in previous years, the Icelandic documentary film festival Skjaldborg will be held in the town.
The festival has been held since 2007 so it has become a strong tradition in the town.
Judging from the campsite demand, good attendance can be expected this year if the weather doesn't spoil things, with DV reporting earlier today that the forecast is awful.
However, the worst weather is expected to be to the south and there is hope for the residents of Patreksfjörður.
The website bb.is first reported this, and said that all other accommodations in town were already fully booked.
