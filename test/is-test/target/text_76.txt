The Glee curse - the tragic fate of the Glee stars
According to a theory that has caught on online, there is a curse on the television series Glee, with actress Naya Rivera's recent drowning death in California making her the third lead actor in the series to die long before their time.
Glee is a popular series about song, dance and joy.
The series revolved around a so-called glee club for high school teenagers, their loves and their destinies.
It was not always easy to be in the glee club, but through song and dance, the characters in the series seemed to overcome all circumstances that arose in their lives.
But off the set, great tragedies have befallen the cast and crew of the series, to the extent that theories have began circulating about there being a curse on the series.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of no-nonsense cheerleader Santana Lopez in the series.
After the conclusion of the series, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey and had with him her first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and they were subsequently divorced.
Dorsey refused to press charges, however, and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On 8 July of this year, Rivera was reported missing after her four-year old son was found drifting alone in a boat on Lake Piru in California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket aboard the boat, and he was able to tell police authorities that he and his mother had dived into the water and River had then put him back in the boat but never returned there herself.
An extensive search for Rivera was launched.
The day after the search began, the chief of police in the area reported that the search was conducted according to the assumption that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially declared dead.
It is believed that she got caught up in a heavy current in the water and used her last remaining strength to save her son.
The cause of death was recorded as accidental drowning.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the series, the American football player with the voice of angel who played a major role in Glee's success.
But outside the series, Moneith faced personal demons.
He had had addiction problems since the age of 13 and found it difficult to escape from them.
In 2013, his co-workers on the series had had enough and staged an intervention to encourage him to seek help.
Moneith subsequently entered rehab and everything seemed to be heading in the right direction.
Only two months after completing his rehab programme, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after a night out partying with his friends.
The cause of death turned out to be a fatal mixture of drugs and alcohol.
The death was not believed to be intentional.
Moneith had been through rehab and his tolerance for intoxicants had become so low that a dose that he could easily tolerate before now proved to be fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he passed away.
His death was a great shock to his co-workers, but at the instigation of his co-star Lea Michele, the decision was made to continue shooting the series, with an entire episode dedicated to the memory of Moneith and his character, Finn.
In the series, Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah „Puck“ Puckerman, who played American football, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the glee club, that is until he worked up the courage to admit that he liked singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his Los Angeles home, suspected of possessing child pornography.
A search of his home revealed enormous quantities of child pornography and the matter soon became public knowledge.
It was obvious that Salling was done.
He was subsequently charged and convicted for his violations.
He was facing four to seven years of prison time, as well as being placed on a register of sex offenders and having to seek treatment for paedophilia.
Before the judge had passed a sentence, Salling, who was out on bail, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
Cast members were not the only ones to die untimely deaths.
Jim Fuller was an assistant director on the series.
He died unexpectedly in his sleep, only 41 years of age.
A woman named Nancy Motes also worked on the series.
She was the younger sister of superstar Julia Roberts and did not speak fondly of her sister, accusing Roberts of being highly controlling and behaving disrespectfully.
Motes, who battled serious depression, took her own life in 2014.
She left a note to her fiancé where she accused her mother and sister of being among the ones responsible for her situation.
“I leave nothing to my mother and so-called siblings except the memory that they were the cause of my worst depression.”
Lea Michel was the star of the series.
She has recently been accused of bullying her co-stars, being aggressive on set and displaying excessive diva-like behaviour.
Jesse Luken had a guest role on the series in 2012.
In 2019, he was arrested and charged with drunk driving, which was considered a huge scandal.
Actress Heather Morris had a major role in the series.
In 2010, unscrupulous computer hackers obtained nude photographs of her and published them online.
Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both had roles in the series and had an off-screen affair.
Benoist later revealed that Jenner had been abusive towards her during their relationship.
