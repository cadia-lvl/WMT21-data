Dominic Raab: Government can't make apologies for Spain quarantine decision
Dominic Raab has defended the Government's decision to re-introduce quarantine measures on Spain at short notice.
Ministers announced on Saturday that holidaymakers who had not returned from Spain and its islands by midnight would be forced to self-isolate for 14 days.
The country had been on a list of "travel corridor" nations deemed safe to visit by Downing Street, but a recent surge in coronavirus cases has sparked fears of a second wave of the disease.
On Sunday, the Foreign Secretary defended the sudden reimposition of restrictions as a "real-time response" to a worrying spike in infections reported in the region.
He said the situation was then assessed yesterday afternoon "and we took the decision as swiftly as we could."
"We can't make apologies for doing so," he added.
"We must be able to take swift, decisive action, particularly in relation to localised, or internationally in relation to Spain or a particular country, where we see we must take action.
"Otherwise, we risk re-infection into the UK, potentially a second wave here and then another lockdown."

The decision was made after Spain recorded more than 900 new daily Covid-19 cases for two days running.
The Foreign Secretary acknowledged that many tourists had been left with no time to cancel or alter their plans.
"I understand it is disruptive for those going through this who are in Spain or have been considering going but we must be able to take swift, decisive action to protect the UK," he said.
"We've made such progress in getting the virus down and preventing the virus re-taking hold in the UK."

Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth condemned the Government for its "frankly shambolic" handling of the measure.
He said Downing Street's sudden decision had left holidaymakers "confused and distressed."
The Labour MP told Sophy Ridge: "I understand why they've made the decision but, of course, the way in which this decision has been made in the last 24 hours is frankly shambolic.
"There are holidaymakers in Spain at the moment confused and distressed, there are people about to go on holiday to Spain and the islands like Tenerife who are confused, and they don't know whether their employers will allow them to take two weeks" quarantine.
"The Government is just saying, "we hope that employers co-operate."
"The way in which this decision has been made in the last 24 hours is frankly shambolic."
What does Spain being on quarantine list mean for holidaymakers?
He urged ministers to offer "clarity" on whether those who are asked to quarantine will receive financial support if their employers refuse to pay them during the quarantine period.
He added that clear information was also needed "for those holidaymakers who are currently in Spain who have properly saved up all year for their family holiday who are confused and distressed."
"The way in which this decision has been communicated is obviously causing anxiety," he stressed.
Mr Raab said no worker following the new guidance should be penalised by employers, including by being put onto sick pay.
He said: "We are changing the rules - the law is changed in relation to holidaymakers and travellers - and of course we expect employers to show those employees who will have to quarantine because of the law the flexibility they need."
"If someone is following the law in relation to quarantine and self-isolating the way they should, they can't have penalties taken against them."
