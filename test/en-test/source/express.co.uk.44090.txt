Tony Blair vows never to stop meddling in British politics despite severe Brexit backlash
Tony Blair has pledged not to stop intervening in UK politics, following severe backlash to his involvement in the Labour Party and anti-Brexit campaigning.
Mr Blair, who has been out of office for more than ten years, told Sophy Ridge on Sky News that he will "never" stop speaking out in British politics.
However, the controversial political figure acknowledged "a lot of people watching this might think I should stop talking about things."
Sophy Ridge told Mr Blair: "I always get the sense you can't wrench yourself away from politics."
"You are always publishing reports on coronavirus or coming up with arguments on Brexit."
"I just wonder if people think, why after ten years of being PM, are you still trying to be involved in politics?"
"Isn't it time to take some time out, go around the golf course."
The former prime minister rejected this and vowed to stay around in UK politics as long as he can.
He said: "It's not something I want to do.  A lot of people watching might think that's exactly what he should do and stop talking about things, but I care about the country."
"We are at a huge moment of change in the world and the institute I built works around the world."
"I know I've done something that previous prime ministers have not done but in the future I predict many more will try to do."
Earlier in the interview, Mr Blair said that the UK and EU could still land a deal on Brexit before the end of the year.
He said: "They could land a deal.  But even the deal we land is going to be bad."
"It's essentially going to be good for Europe because it will allow easier trade in goods but very inhibiting for us on the issue of services."
The former Labour leader also told Sky News the UK is going to be living with COVID-19, not eliminating it, for the foreseeable future.
