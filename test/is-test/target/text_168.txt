Tens of people in quarantine and several of them starting to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five have been diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically in the last three days and most of those infected are unconnected.
Tens of people are now in quarantine because of this and several of them are beginning to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically and two in border screenings.
An expert at the Directorate of Health says that the growing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is becoming more widespread in the community.
"A sequence analysis of the first domestic infection has been carried out and that was a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to believe that it was undetected in the community for any length of time.
This is probably something that has recently come to the country, but of course we have to be especially vigilant now," said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, expert at the Directorate of Health's Disease Prevention Department.
Most of those infected have been in contact with individuals who came from overseas.
More testing will be conducted soon, but several of those who were in contact with those infected are beginning to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
"There is no influenza going around now and there are fewer other respiratory infections so we can be rather liberal in performing these tests on individuals for whom there would have been considered reason to do something else first during times of influenza," said Kamilla.
Tracing of the infections has mostly been completed but it is not impossible that more will have to be quarantined.
Two of those infected were diagnosed after attending sports events.
This has raised questions of whether it is justifiable to hold such events.
The Communications Director of the Department of Civil Protection says that it's completely possible as long as people comply with guidelines and rules.
Kamilla says that it's practically impossible for those infected to have been infected at the sports tournaments.
"If more people are not isolated as a result of being in contact with these individuals at these sports tournaments, we could argue that our disease prevention measures at the tournaments were effective.
But this is not clear yet," said Kamilla.
The Department of Civil Protection's procedures are constantly being reexamined, she says.
"We have to be ready to intervene with further recommendations or restrictions if there seems to be reason to do so," said Kamilla.
In just over a week, crowd restrictions will be eased to allow one thousand people.
This new situation could have an effect on the easing of restrictions.
