Seattle protesters clash with police over Trump's 'surge' of federal agents plan
Police in Seattle used flashbang grenades and pepper spray on Saturday against protesters who set fire to construction trailers outside a youth jail, amid a wave of public anger over President Donald Trump's planned "surge" of federal agents into major cities.
The sounds of repeated small detonations rang out in the streets of the city in Washington state, and smoke rose from an area where demonstrators had set fire to trailers by a construction site for the youth detention facility.
Demonstrators slashed car tires and smashed trailer windows.
Police in riot gear faced off against the demonstrators, some of whom held up umbrellas against falling pellets of pepper spray.
The Seattle Times newspaper quoted police as saying 16 people were arrested on suspicion of assault against officers, obstruction and failure to disperse.
