Bought a boat after tenth grade
"I don't think there's many of us sailors working in the country's preschools," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who is an inshore fisherman in the summer and studies psychology at the University of Iceland in winter.
"Inshore fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you're a student.
You can have a good income if the fishing is good, and I think it's great to be able to avoid taking student loans.
My income also lasts well into the winter," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year old psychology student who works as an inshore fisherman this summer, like in previous summers.
Axel had just docked in the Tálknafjörður harbour when this reporter met up with him late one evening at the start of the week.
"During my 10th grade winter, I got a licence to skipper boats under 12 metres in length, and I bought my boat in the summer after I finished elementary school.
I have been inshore fishing on my boat every summer since then.
I bought a used boat from my acquaintance, Hartmann Jónsson, and named the boat after him.
Hartmann was getting on in years and had retired from fishing by the time I bought his boat, and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
"I made an agreement with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of summer and the other half at the end of summer, when I was done fishing.
So I owned the boat, debt-free, at the end of my first summer on it."
But how could a boy own one and a half million to use as a down payment on a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
"I had saved and raised money, I went out to sea with my dad when I was a boy, I spent all summers fishing with him and got my share.
I also put the money from my confirmation into my boat fund."
Axel was born in Ísafjörður, the home of all his maternal relatives, but has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
"I'm allowed to fish here in the western area because my domicile is with my grandmother in Ísafjörður.
I learned about these spots out here in the west from going fishing with my dad.
I move from fjord to fjord according to how I feel, because this fishing zone extends across the entire Westfjords.
Although I think it's best to be out west, I have also fished around Snæfellsnes and in other places.
I have also gone fishing down south, but then it's mainly lumpfish," says Axel, who always sails out alone in the very early hours of the morning and says that he'll sometimes talk to the seagulls and sing to the sky in his hours of solitude in the middle of the ocean.
"There's good internet connection out at sea so I can make calls and listen to podcasts and music.
I don't find it difficult at all to be alone on the boat.
Of course I try to avoid danger, but there have certainly been instances of something going wrong with the weather, although never any great risk," says Axel, who is lucky in that he is never seasick.
He says that the length of the working day depends on how the fishing goes each time.
"In inshore fishing, I never spend more than 14 hours fishing at a time, but I have also been fishing according to other systems, the hired quota system, for instance, where I have been out at sea fishing for one and a half days without interruption.
He says that according to the inshore fishing arrangement, he's allowed to catch 770 kilos per day, which he feels is restrictive.
"Other restrictions are not being allowed to fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I'm only allowed to fish for twelve days a month for the four months of inshore fishing, May, June, July and August.
I believe that sailors should pick their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.
There is this unnecessary pressure to go out fishing instead of having 48 days over the whole summer and being able to pick them as you please.
I also wouldn't mind if the division into zones would stop, in which case the fishing villages that are ideally located close to fishing grounds should be allowed to reap the benefits," says Axel, whose main catch in his inshore fishing is cod, along with some saithe and the occasional other species.
During the winter, Axel works at the preschool Núpur in Kópavogur alongside his university studies.
"I don't think there's many of us sailors working in the country's preschools," says Axel with pride, adding that he only intended to work temporarily at the preschool.
"I got stuck there because I think it's a wonderful job.
I hope that the psychology studies will be useful for me at the preschool level," says Axel, who is also well on his way in his business administration studies.
