Barcelona 'have whole side to sell' this summer as Coutinho, Dembele, Rakitic and Vidal all listed for transfers
BARCELONA will be known as a selling club this summer, according to reports.
No fewer than 12 first team stars have been transfer-listed by the La Liga giants, claim Marca.
Philippe Coutinho has been reportedly transfer-listed by Barcelona
And those include Premier League targets Philippe Coutinho, Ousmane Dembele, Ivan Rakitic and Samuel Umtiti.
Coutinho and Umtiti have both been linked with moves to Arsenal, with the Brazilian also being eyed up by Chelsea.
While Manchester United and Tottenham are said to be in a battle for Rakitic's services.
French World Cup winner Dembele, who has struggled for game time at the Camp Nou, was recently linked with a move to PSG in a swap deal with Neymar.
The other players who are deemed surplus to requirements include Neto, Nelson Semedo, Junior Firpo, Arturo Vidal, Martin Braithwaite, Carles Alena, Rafinha Alcantara, and Jean-Clair Todibo.
Barcelona are hoping a clear out will not only boost their finances, but aid their future transfer business.
Ousmane Dembele is also said to be surplus to requirements
According to the Spanish newspaper, Barcelona have already identified their transfer targets for next season - with Argentinian forward Lautaro Martinez top of their hit list.
But Inter Milan are continuing to ask for his Â£101million release clause to be met before negotiating with the Catalans.
Barcelona will have to sell before they can buy, but remain confident that they can strike a deal with the Serie A side.
