All main news from the second day of the Championships
The 94th Icelandic Track and Field Championships were concluded at Þór Field in Akureyri today.
Several tournament records were set on the second day of competition.
An exciting competition in the women's hammer throw at Þór Field was expected, as in 2014, FH's Vigdís Jónsdóttir set an Icelandic hammer throw record that remained until ÍR's Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir broke the record in May of last year.
Vigdís reclaimed her Icelandic record earlier this summer and has been in fantastic form recently, improving her Icelandic record three times since the beginning of summer.
Elísabet Rut has been suffering from injuries and did not achieve good results today.
She had only one valid throw in five attempts, throwing the hammer 25.69 metres, which is far from her best.
Vigdís had the longest throw today, or 60.08 metres in her last attempt, which was also a tournament record.
The Icelandic record she set earlier in July was 62.69 metres so she was quite far from matching that.
ÍR's Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir had the second best throw of the day, improving on her best result with a 50.18 metre throw.
In the men's event, FH's Hilmar Örn Jónsson, who holds the Icelandic hammer throw record, won comfortably with a throw of 73.84 metres in his next to last attempt, thereby setting a tournament record.
His Icelandic record in the discipline is 75.26 metres.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, Olympic competitor and holder of the Icelandic discus record, won the shot put competition at Þór Field yesterday, but today he competed in the discus event, which is his main discipline.
Guðni Valur's Icelandic record is 65.53 metres but his best throw today was 59.13 metres, which secured his victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson had the second longest throw today, his single valid throw, which landed him in second place, 49.43 metres.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, holder of the Icelandic long jump record, won the long jump event today by a wide margin with her longest jump of 6.25 metres, which is just under 40 cm from her Icelandic record.
In the women's 200-metre dash, ÍR's Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir proved to be the fastest, reaching the finishing line in 24.04 seconds, with her Icelandic record in the discipline being 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was victorious in Akureyri, winning two gold medals yesterday, in the 100-metre dash and the 4 x 100-metre relay race, as well as in the 4 x 400-metre relay race today.
In the men's event, FH's Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson was first in the 200-metre dash, coming in at 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds before Ármann's Óliver Máni Samúelsson.
Like Guðbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn secured the gold in the 100-metre dash yesterday, as well as in the 400-metre dash.
