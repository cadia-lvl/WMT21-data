Bicycle whisperer Bjartmar has recovered bicycles worth millions - now defends himself after DV's report
For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had a hobby unlike most others.
He finds and rescues lost and stolen bicycles, electric bikes and scooters.
Due to this, Bjartmar has been called the "bicycle whisperer".
There was quite a commotion yesterday, however, when a man published an account of his interactions with Bjartmar.
DV referred to a discussion in a Facebook group for residents in West Reykjavik where Bjartmar was reported to have approached the man on Austurvöllur and said that his scooter was possibly stolen.
The original post from the man on the electric scooter seemed to say that Bjartmar had accused him of theft.
This text has now been edited on Facebook and the headline of DV's original report has been updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says that the original reports of the matter were in no way indicative of what actually transpired at Austurvöllur yesterday.
Bjartmar said that he received information from the victim of an electric scooter theft that this was certainly his electric scooter.
This was information that the alleged owner received from someone else, but this information turned out to be wrong, says Bjartmar.
"I saw the guy and the scooter was familiar to me, as I had information that this was an electric scooter that had been missing and searched for for a very long time.
I was certainly hesitant at first, but when I saw him prepare to drive away on the scooter, I decided to take the plunge and talk to the man.
The owner was certain in his belief so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
I'm generally very subtle in such matters, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had interrupted me."
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric scooter immediately offered to show him the receipt for the scooter and called the police himself.
"Yes, great," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this sorted."
The owner of the electric scooter eventually proved his ownership and rode away.
Later, the actual owner of the electric scooter told his story on Facebook, as was detailed in the previous report.
In the more than a year that Bjartmar has been doing this, he says he can count on the fingers of one hand the times he got into altercations with people.
"I have had peaceful interactions with Reykjavik's most difficult men," said Bjartmar and points out that in the vast majority of cases, bicycle thieves are society's most vulnerable brothers and sisters, addicts, people with mental disorders and people who are on the street for some reason.
"Addiction is a merciless taskmaster, the next fix must be funded somehow and unfortunately, stealing these kinds of movable properties is an easy way to reach that goal," says Bjartmar.
"In fact, my interactions with these people are actually so good that many of these good people are now on my side.
There are examples of people going to rehab and straightening themselves out and then coming to me to assist me in what I'm doing," he says.
He says that his interactions with cyclists are generally polite.
Some are aware of him and what he's doing and volunteer peacefully to show him receipts, bicycle frame numbers, etc.
Bicycle theft is a big problems that has been little reported, he says.
Bjartmar adds that the police is even beginning to advise people to talk to him about stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is displeased with DV's previous reporting and says that he not some kind of vigilante on a personal quest for justice.
When asked whether he isn't going too far in his activities, and whether this is not first and foremost the role of the police, Bjartmar says that that is certainly the case.
"Of course the cops should do this, but the fact of the matter is that the cops are simply not tending to this.
I have seen policemen drive away from a large pile of stolen bicycles, for example.
They are completely useless in these matters, to tell you the truth."
"When the cops aren't doing anything about this, and it's just right in front of you and experience has shown that I can get results in these cases, then why not?" asks Bjartmar.
He says that he has been so successful in finding lost bicycles that sometimes when he has run into his "protégés" on the street, they have simply handed the bicycles that they had snatched over to Bjartmar.
In the instances when Bjartmar has requested assistance from the police, they have sometimes simply not shown up.
"It's just not working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the fault of the bicycle owners," said Bjartmar, who is sorry that victims of bicycle theft have to suffer the disinterest of police when it comes to this issue.
Bjartmar's success rate is undisputable.
Stories from people thanking Bjartmar for retrieving their properties are rampant.
Bjartmar himself says that he has long ago lost count of the bicycles that he has returned, but that the amounts are probably in the millions, if not the tens of millions.
That is largely due to electric scooters, e-bikes and mobility scooters, with electric bikes sometimes costing up to half a million.
Bjartmar works at a preschool during the day and at a group home every other weekend.
His search for bicycles is therefore unpaid work that he undertakes in his spare time.
