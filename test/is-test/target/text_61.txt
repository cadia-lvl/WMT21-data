Found a worm in a woman's neck
Doctors at the St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo discovered a 3.8 cm long black worm in the tonsil of a woman who sought treatment there.
The doctors were able to pull the worm out with pliers.
Tests showed that this was a parasite.
CNN reported this.
The woman had eaten sashimi, which is thin slices of meat, a few days earlier.
The woman recovered quickly when the worm had been removed. Parasites such as this are often found in raw meat or fish.
Since the advent of sushi in the West, cases of parasites in people have increased, according to CNN.
