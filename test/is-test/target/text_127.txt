Not reversed until after the vote
It is still not clear whether the dismissals of Icelandair airline hostesses, which are supposed to enter into effect at the end of this month, will be reversed.
The online voting on the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association's collective wage agreement on behalf of Icelandair airline hostesses will conclude at noon tomorrow.
Association president Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir says she is convinced that Icelandair will not make a decision on the dismissals until the results of the vote are known.
"This is obviously linked," says Guðlaug Líney.
"No dismissals have been reversed. This must become clear soon so the aeroplanes can be manned.
Of course, people are also anxious to know whether they will have a job next month."
The vote is on an agreement signed a week ago, in the early hours of 19 July.
It is expected to have an effective term until the end of September 2025, and it is based on an agreement previously rejected in a vote by the Cabin Crew Association.
On 17 July, the board and council of the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association decided to suspend all work at Icelandair and the decision was approved in a vote by the members.
This was never done, but the decision was made following Icelandair's decision to suspend negotiations with the Cabin Crew Association, dismiss all its airline hostesses and seek to negotiate with another trade union.
The company's pilots were also meant to take on temporary positions as security officers on board.
When asked how she thinks the vote will go, Guðlaug Líney says it's difficult to say.
"People are hurt after this attack by Icelandair where all the company's airline hostesses were dismissed and it was announced that they would conclude an agreement with another trade union.
It will now become clear whether this has an effect," she says.
940 airline hostesses were employed by Icelandair in late April when 900 of them, about 95%, were dismissed.
Their notice of termination varies. For the ones with the shortest work experience it is three months, so their notice period ends at the end of July/start of August.
About 90% of Icelandair's airline hostesses belong to this group.
What happens next if the agreement is not approved?
"Then we'll request further negotiations with our counterparty.
With this agreement, we are meeting Icelandair's demands.
If it is rejected, the airline hostesses obviously feel that this was a step too far."
