An uphill battle with one hundred days until the elections
In one hundred days, Americans will go to the polls to elect a President for the next four years.
Donald Trump seeks reelection but faces an uphill battle.
Joe Biden, the expected Democratic candidate, has a big nationwide lead on Trump if opinion polls are to be believed.
According to a recent survey by the AP news agency, a record number of Americans believe that the nation is headed in the wrong direction.
Trump's response to the novel coronavirus pandemic is also highly unpopular, in addition to which an increasing number of Americans believe that the President has handled the economy poorly.
More precisely, only two out of ten Americans say that the United States are heading in the right direction.
32 percent say that they support Trump's response to the pandemic, and 48 percent say that he has handled the economy well.
That proportion was 56 percent in March and 67 percent in January.
According to FiveThirtyEight's average, Biden's support is 49.9 percent nationwide while Trump's support is 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has attempted to shift the focus away from his response to the pandemic and onto Biden, promote the so-called culture gap and announce policies intended to revolve around law and order.
Meanwhile, the Biden campaign makes great efforts to keep the focus on Trump, believing that there's a great chance of victory if the elections will actually revolve around Trump's performance in office over the past four years.
Trump's unpopularity also seems likely to have a negative effect on Republican senators, and prominent Republicans fear that Democrats might even gain a majority in the US Senate, which has been considered highly unlikely until now.
Politico recently reported that if support for parties and candidate remained similar to what it is now, the Republican Party would suffer its biggest defeat in decades.
Suburbs had proved to be particularly bad for the party in the 2016 senate elections and the trend was likely to continue now.
In recent days, Trump has tried to scare suburbanites into supporting him, including by claiming that if elected President, Biden will destroy the suburbs of America and increase racial tensions.
One of Trump's measures was to repeal a regulation from Obama's time in the White House intended to increase diversity in the suburbs.
He also encouraged "housewives" in American suburbs to read an article by a former New York lieutenant governor who claimed that Biden would destroy American suburbs, which Trump agreed with.
"Biden will destroy your neighbourhoods and the American dream.
I will preserve it, and make it even better!" said the President.
Suburban residents are an ever-growing proportion of voters.
According to NPR, they make up about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since the reelection of George W. Bush in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of votes from this segment has become President.
The exception was in 2012, when Mitt Romney received the majority of votes from this segment but lost to Barack Obama.
Polls have shown that although Trump secured a narrow majority of suburban voters in 2016, his support among them has decreased significantly.
Although polls have varied, Biden has recently been measured as having a fifteen percent lead on Trump in the suburbs.
