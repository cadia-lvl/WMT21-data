Buyers quick to act on coveted Lovely Banks lifestyle property
The bigger is better philosophy clearly rang true for the new owners of a sprawling Lovely Banks property that's just sold for $1.277m.
Buyers seeking a lifestyle address not far from central Geelong lined up to inspect the 1.35ha offering that has garaging for 14 cars, a swimming pool and views over Corio Bay.
Harcourts, North Geelong agent Joe Grgic said 1 Cuddihy Court went under offer within 10 days of hitting the market.

"We had multiple offers from different parties," Mr Grgic said.
"It sold to a local guy who is very excited."
The property comes with a two-storey, four-bedroom house that includes a huge ensuite, large enough to accommodate a couch.
The new owners will also enjoy three living areas, a renovated kitchen and an updated outdoor entertainment area overlooking the pool.
"It was the combination of the lifestyle property, being three acres, and it's right there," Mr Grgic said.
"I had some Melbourne buyers come down and they couldn't believe its proximity to everything but yet it had that rural feel.
"I actually have people who missed out and buyers that are still looking."
He said the generous shedding, which includes a double garage and separate shed which can accommodate 10-12 vehicles, was perfect for tradies or storing caravans and trailers.
