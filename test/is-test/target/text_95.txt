Postponed the wedding because of the pandemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was supposed to marry the former Bachelorette contender Wells Adams this summer.
"I think that there are other, more important things to think about right now," said the actress in an interview with People.
"We definitely want to get married one day and have the wedding of our dreams with all our loved ones present.
But we decided to postpone it and focus on what's important right now, and that's helping to spread information about wearing masks and staying at home.
I'm more focused on global issues than wedding issues these days.
There are many things going on and we should turn our attention to what's happening in the world."
