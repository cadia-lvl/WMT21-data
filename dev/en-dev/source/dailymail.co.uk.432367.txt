White Lines star Laura Haddock, 34, goes house-hunting with her 28-year-old lover Tom Rhys Harries
They started dating on the set of White Lines, a drama about debauchery on Ibiza - but when Laura Haddock and her boyfriend Tom Rhys Harries went house-hunting last week, they cut an image of relaxed calm far from the hedonism of the party island.
The couple, who played brother and sister in the hit Netflix series, were spotted as they viewed a stunning Oxfordshire farmhouse, which is on the market for Â£1.2 million.
They arrived in a Range Rover driven by Laura, 34, wearing denim shorts and a white top, and were met by an estate agent who ushered them inside for a look around the five-bedroom home.
In White Lines, which was filmed last autumn, Laura played Zoe Walker, who discovers the seedy side of Ibiza as she investigates the murder of her DJ brother Axel, played by 28-year-old Tom.
News of their relationship only emerged earlier this month, less than a year after the collapse of Laura's six-year marriage to Sam Claflin, who starred in The Hunger Games films.
Together they have a son, four-year-old Pip, and a daughter Margot, two.
When they announced their split last August, Claflin, 34, wrote on Instagram: "Laura and I have decided to legally separate. We will move forward with nothing but love, friendship and a deep respect for one another whilst we continue to raise our family together."
Laura and Sam first met in 2011 at an audition and Sam, who's also been in Peaky Blinders, described their marriage in 2013 as "easily one of his greatest achievements."
Before White Lines, Laura appeared in the first Inbetweeners film and last year's BBC crime-drama The Capture, playing lawyer Hannah Roberts.
Tom has appeared in the Inbetweeners sequel and Sky drama Britannia.
