Campaign against obesity following the coronavirus pandemic
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will allocate 10 million pounds to a campaign against obesity, which will include a ban on fast food advertising, following his serious illness, which was partly due to his weight.
The plan is for Johnson to launch the campaign, which has been named Better Health, tomorrow, Monday. As part of the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe cycling for their overweight patients and efforts will be made to increase the number of cycling paths.
In addition, television advertising for fast food restaurants will be banned before nine o'clock in the evening, according to British media sources.
"COVID-19 has given us a wake-up call of the immediate and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is clear we must use this time to get healthier, more active and eat more wholesome food," a government spokesperson was quoted as saying.
Johnson himself has had weight problems. He was admitted to an intensive care unit when he caught the coronavirus last spring, and the severity of his illness is believed to be partly due to his weight.
