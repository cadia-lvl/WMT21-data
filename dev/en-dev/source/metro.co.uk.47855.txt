Fleetwood told PA: "For me, and every past and present member of Fleetwood Mac, losing Peter Green is monumental.
"Peter was the man who started the band Fleetwood Mac along with myself, John McVie, and Jeremy Spencer.
No one has ever stepped into the ranks of Fleetwood Mac without a reverence for Peter Green and his talent, and to the fact that music should shine bright and always be delivered with uncompromising passion."
The 73 year old rock legend added: "Peter, I will miss you, but rest easy your music lives on.
I thank you for asking me to be your drummer all those years ago.
We did good, and trail blazed one hell of a musical road for so many to enjoy.
"God speed to you, my dearest friend.......  Love Mick Fleetwood."
Confirming Green's death, a statement from Swan Turton solicitors read: "It is with great sadness that the family of Peter Green announce his death this weekend, peacefully in his sleep.
"A further statement will be provided in the coming days."
Green is survived by his daughter, Rosebud Samuels-Greenbaum, who she shared with ex-wife Jane Samuels.
Green formed Fleetwood Mac with bandmates Mick Fleetwood and Jeremy Spencer, with the band originally called Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac featuring Jeremy Spencer.
However, the singer-songwriter would leave the group in 1970, after four albums.
Fleetwood Mac would go on to achieve great acclaim and worldwide fame with additional line-ups including Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks on seminal albums including Rumours and Tusk.
