Former ÍBV player experienced racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Former ÍBV player Tonny Mawejje says he experienced racism while in Iceland and that he regrets coming to the country.
This was reported in an interview with Tonny in the Ugandan media outlet Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC, a team in the Ugandan top division.
Tonny discusses various subjects in his interview with the Daily Monitor, including his time in Iceland, where he played with ÍBV, Valur and Þróttur.
"When I came to Iceland, I didn't play centre like I'm used to.
The team captain played that position and he also had the shirt number that I wanted so I got neither of the things I wanted," says Tonny, who played as a right winger during his season with ÍBV.
Among the subjects discussed by Tonny is the racism he experienced in Iceland.
He says that this is a problem experienced by many black players when they play in Europe.
"This happened to me once but as I didn't understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
I heard about it later and asked my friend what this thing was about.
Then he told me that my opponent had made racist remarks about me after I tackled him."
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland for Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
He says that it was there that he made the mistake that he regrets the most.
Tonny had not been able to get on the starting team at Haugesund but he wanted to play more to get on the national team.
He then asked to return to Iceland on loan, after which he joined Valur.
"It was a mistake to return to Iceland on loan.
I think that if I would have stayed in Norway, I would have gotten the opportunity I wanted," says Tonny, who hoped that if he played well in Norway, he would probably go further.
He claims that his loan to Iceland destroyed his dream of joining a major European team.
