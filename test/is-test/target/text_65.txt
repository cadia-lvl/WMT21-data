Five new infections in Iceland - three domestic
Three domestic infections were diagnosed yesterday, as well as two more at the border.
Thus, five individuals tested positive for Covid-19 in Iceland yesterday.
According to a Civil Protection announcement, one infection is connected to the infection reported at the ReyCUP football tournament yesterday.
The individual in question has been placed in isolation and sixteen people who were in close contact with him were quarantined.
The infected individual took part in the activities of a sport club in Reykjavik and "only a part of the sports team" is in quarantine, according to the announcement.
Others who were quarantined have other connections to the man.
The source of this infection has not been found and the infection is currently being traced by the National Commissioner of Police's tracing team.
Organisers of the ReyCUP tournament have complied with the guidelines and rules from the Chief Epidemiologist and Department of Civil Protection that are still in effect, and appropriate measures have been made.
Photos from the tournament, showing people celebrating the success of their team in very close contact out on the field, also drew attention yesterday.
Just before 11 o'clock, the organisers of the tournament published the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It reads: "NOTE: Parents are please asked to respect the rule of participants fetching their thing from the school themselves.
Parents are NOT allowed to do it.
Thank you for your understanding."
Another infection was diagnosed yesterday, but that infection is connected to an infection reported the day before yesterday.
The announcement says: "deCode Genetics has performed a sequence analysis of the infections, which has revealed a new type of virus that has not been detected here before."
Tracing of that infection is also underway, and the infected individual is in isolation and 12 are in quarantine because of the infection.
The third infection is with a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, on 15 July.
He was diagnosed in the southwest corner of the country.
That man is now in isolation and six people who were in close contact with him are in quarantine.
Two of them are already beginning to show symptoms of a viral infection.
In addition, two were diagnosed at the border and the results of further examinations are pending, as provided for in the procedures for infections at the border.
Finally, the announcement reads: The Civil Protection Department of the National Commissioner of Police and the Directorate of Health remind everyone to be careful and follow individual disease prevention measures carefully.
If there is the slightest chance of Covid-19 symptoms being present, the individual in question is asked to undergo testing at the nearest healthcare centre.
