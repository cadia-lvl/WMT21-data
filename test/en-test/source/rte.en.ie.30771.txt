Gwyneth Paltrow wants kids to have good 'worth ethic'
Gwyneth Paltrow has said she wants to raise her children to have a good worth ethic as she tries 'not to just hand them things'.
Paltrow has two children, Apple (16) and Moses (14), with ex-husband Chris Martin and she wants them to have good values and not get by on their parents fame.
"That's why I think it's so important...  To raise a kid that has a work ethic and whose values are aligned with yours or with their own sense of who they are, etc," she told Rob Lowe on his podcast.
"The truth of the matter is the doors can be opened for you, but if you think about all the people who try and it doesn't happen."
She added, "As a parent you think, all I can do for these kids is teach them right from wrong and teach them what work is. I've really have tried not to just hand them things."
Paltrow has also taken steps to allow her children to live as privately as possible, and ensures they keep their social media accounts private.
"I won't let them be public on any social media or anything like that, I try to keep them out of the public eye as much as possible," she said.
"You know, now it's different, 'cause kids are like, 'Can I have a YouTube channel?' and I'm like, 'No, you can't.
Absolutely not."
