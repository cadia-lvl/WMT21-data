One of those infected did not observe return hygiene measures
One of the three diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday arrived from a Baltic state on 15 July, about one and a half weeks ago.
He is Icelandic but not a permanent resident here so he did not receive clear instructions about observing the so-called return hygiene measures after coming to the country by being tested again a few days after arrival.
His screening at the border produced negative results.
"But he is in Icelandic society and actually should have used that remedy," says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, expert at the Directorate of Health's Disease Prevention Department and acting Chief Epidemiologist during the latter's summer vacation, in an interview with Fréttablaðið today.
"He used the English registration form, where it is not required to record your identification number, and if the identification number is not recorded, you are not automatically summoned to be tested for the second time."
She says that the man was able to use the English registration form because he does in fact reside abroad, but because of his contact network in Iceland, as an Icelander, he should rather have used the Icelandic one.
He did not realise this, however.
"When the identification number is not registered, you have to request the second test yourself.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realised that this was the right thing to do," says Kamilla.
"It is therefore clear that we have to provide more information on this while we find some way to make an automatic summoning system despite Icelanders not registering their identification number.
Or somehow making it more obvious who are participants in Icelandic society in the registration system," she explains.
Fortunately, the man in question was not in contact with many people when he came to the country despite being defined as a participant in Icelandic society, being Icelandic.
Only six have been quarantined since he was diagnosed yesterday, and all six were in contact with him.
They have yet be tested but two are beginning to show symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man tested negative when tested at the border on 15 July.
Kamilla says that he was probably so recently infected by the virus that it could not yet be detected in him when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out that the man was infected here in Iceland rather than bringing the virus with him to the country.
"You can't claim with absolute certainty that this is definitely an imported infection as it's been so long since he came to the country that he could have been exposed here, like the two people who have caused a little stir in connection with the sports tournaments."
She says that this is highly unlikely, however, because of how few people the man was in contact with here.
"It's actually highly unlikely," says Kamilla but notes that it can't be ruled out until deCode Genetics have completed their sequence analysis of the man's virus.
"If we get a type of virus that has not been seen here before, it is almost certain that he brought it to the country."
