Gareth Bale's situation at Real Madrid is 'unsatisfactory for everyone', says Toni Kroos
Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos says Gareth Bale's situation at the Spanish side is 'unsatisfactory for everyone'.
Bale did not feature in any of the last seven games and was a peripheral figure in Los Blancos' LaLiga celebrations ahead of a summer stand-off as the player looks to stay and see out his contract and the club hope he will leave.
"There is no way to avoid the situation being unsatisfactory for everyone," Kroos told the Lauschangriff Endlich was mit Sport! podcast.
"They certainly didn't sign him to play as little as he is now.
"I think in principle he wanted to leave last summer and that the club said 'yes' in principle and then 'no' after that.
"I don't know if he's still a little angry because of that.  It's a difficult matter."
Asked if the situation had a negative effect on the atmosphere at Real, Kroos said: "Certainly not as much as it might seem.
"Everything is good with the team.  I have known him for six years and we have won some important things together."
