Troops destroy bandits' camp, eliminate bandits in Zamfara State
The air interdiction missions conducted by the Air Component of Operation HADARIN DAJI have destroyed a new camp belonging to the armed gang headed by the bandit leader known as "Dangote" in the Doumborou Forest area of Zamfara State.
The Coordinator Defence Media Operations, Major General John Enenche said the airstrike, which also resulted in the killing of several armed bandits, was executed following Human Intelligence (HUMINT) reports as well as series of confirmatory aerial surveillance missions.
Major General Enenche said the HUMINT established that members of the gang, along with their logistics items, motorcycles and hundreds of rustled livestock, had relocated from their erstwhile position to the new area by a rocky high ground within the Forest.
Enenche said the Air Component, therefore, dispatched an enhanced force package of Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter jets and helicopter gunships to attack the location.
According to him "the attack aircraft engaged the target area scoring accurate hits and taking out some of the bandits.
Many others, who were seen trying to flee the location in disarray, were mopped-up in follow-on attacks."
While commending the Air Component of Operation HADARIN DAJI for its professionalism, the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, urged them to remain resolute in the conduct of airstrikes against armed bandits.
The Chief of the Air Staff tasked them to continue to provide close air support for the ongoing ground operations in order to eradicate all armed bandits and restore normalcy to the North-West and North-Central zones of the Country.
