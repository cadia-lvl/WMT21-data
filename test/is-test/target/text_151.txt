Did not want to leave the police station after an overnight stay
The Reykjavík Metropolitan Police dealt with about fifty incidents today and according to the Police Diary, the nature of these incidents was diverse.
The day at the police station on Hverfisgata began with the police having to deal with a man who had just been let out of a holding cell where he had been held because of drunk driving.
The man refused to leave when he was set free and ignored the orders of police to leave the premises.
The man's conduct earned him an extension of his stay at the police station.
A man was arrested in the early hours, suspected of breaking into a business in Kópavogur.
The police also had to deal with two men in Breiðholt because of a reported assault.
A woman who had enjoyed a meal at a shopping centre in Kópavogur was unable to pay the check so the police was called.
A car was also reported stolen in the town centre this morning.
Someone took off in a white Renault van while its driver left it briefly unattended.
The car has not been found.
