Fear another wave of the pandemic
Spanish authorities are doing what little they can to prevent the further spread of COVID—19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID—19 on both Thursday and Friday.
There have not been more cases in a single day since early May, with these reports coming at the same time as Spain begins lifting one of Europe's strictest curfew restrictions.
Because of this backlash, UK authorities now require passengers arriving from Spain to be quarantined upon their return.
A week earlier, Spain was on the UK's list of safe countries.
One of the places most affected by the situation is Catalonia in Northeastern Spain, where authorities have enacted more widespread measures to try to curb the spread.
In the capital of Catalonia, clubs will be closed for the next two weeks and bars will have to close at midnight.
A curfew is also currently in effect for the 200,000 residents of the county of Segria in West Catalonia.
It is believed that the UK's decision will have a negative effect on the Spanish economy, which relies to a large extent on foreign tourists and is in bad shape from the pandemic.
Tui, the UK's largest travel agency, cancelled all flights to Spain and the Canary Islands that were scheduled today.
Authorities all over the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the pandemic, but there seems to be little interest in reinstating extensive curfews, which have devastated the economy in many places.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, for example, has reacted very negatively to such ideas, comparing them to a nuclear weapon that he does not want to use.
French Prime Minister Jean Castex has also said that the nation "would not survive, economically or socially" if nationwide curfews would be reinstated.
Many officials hope that local measures extending to the residents of individual towns, cities or regions will be enough to contain the virus in the event of another round.
