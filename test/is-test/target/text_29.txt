Fear that another wave is starting in Europe
Spain is now the focal point of concerns about a second wave of coronavirus infections in Europe, with authorities there taking measures to contain the new spread of coronavirus.
In Catalonia, all nightlife has been put on hold for two weeks, but Barcelona is not the only city where infections are on the rise.
Other European countries have also taken measures to respond to the increase in infections in Spain: in the UK, all travellers returning from Spain must be quarantined, as is the case in Norway, and French citizens have been advised against travelling to Spain.
Infections are also increasing again in France and Germany, where authorities are trying to find a balance between containing the spread of the virus and getting the economy going again.
However, the state of things in Europe is good compared to other parts of the world, with close to 300,000 daily infections worldwide, mostly in the Americas and South Asia.
Confirmed infections across the world have now reached 16 million, according calculations from Johns Hopkins University, and confirmed deaths connected to the virus have reached 644 thousand.
