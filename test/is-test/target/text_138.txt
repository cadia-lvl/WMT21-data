Gerður's mosaic will finally come into its own
There is a big and deep hole in front of the Customs House in Reykjavik.
In it are men with orange helmets.
There is also a big excavator there.
And other smaller machines.
The road is closed for traffic.
But the pavement is clear and many people now stop there to observe artwork made from millions of mosaic tiles  — like they have never seen it before.
Perhaps they never have seen it before.
At least not observed it.
The mural has been relatively hidden until now, right in front of it were parking spaces that were in constant demand.
People parked there, quickly locked their car and then rushed to perform their errands in the city centre.
"Lively and diverse public spaces" and "an attractive urban environment" are the guiding themes in the renovation of Tryggvagata that is currently underway.
The aim is to beautify the area and make Gerður Helgadóttir's mosaic on the Customs House more prominent.
There will be a square in front of the mural, and the site is considered well suited as a leisure area for pedestrians due to its advantageous sunlight position.
The mural will be illuminated, enabling a better appreciation of the material on this 142 square metre surface.
The site will also have small "fog sprinklers", a kind of water sculptures that provide an opportunity for play and lend the place a certain mystical air.
This is how the renovations are described by the City of Reykjavik, which is responsible for the project, along with Veitur.
Cold water, hot water and electrical utilities will be renewed.
Many of these are getting on in age, with the sewage and cold water pipelines dating from the year 1925, thus having served residents and businesses in the city centre for close to a century.
Cars will again be able to drive on the road when it will be reopened following the end of the construction project.
It will be a one-way street, however, which will also create a more tranquil and accessible space for pedestrians.
According to the information on the Customs House on the Directorate of Custom's website, the building, by architect Gísli Halldórsson, was taken into use in 1971.
As a dock warehouse extended through the building, there was a 250 square metre windowless wall surface facing the street.
The building committee and architect agreed that such a surface would have a negative effect on the overall look of the street if special measures were not made to decorate the building.
The parties therefore agreed to assume that permanent artwork would be installed there.
Gerður Helgadóttir had a great reputation as an artist during this period, according to the summary.
She had been heavily involved in making mosaics in Germany and other places.
A decision was made to contact her first, before deciding whether a competition for the project would be held.
It had often been noted that the artwork would have to reflect life at the harbour, as the harbour had been Reykjavik's lifeline ever since it was built.
When the artist was contacted, she was immediately captivated by the task.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before leaving the country again to work on the proposals abroad.
Gerður was given the time that she herself decided she needed and upon her return home, she submitted several proposals for discussion.
It was agreed without delay to ask her to carry out the task.
A request was also made to make a comprehensive agreement with her and the famous German art company Oidtmann Brothers, Gerður's long-time collaborators in installing renowned works of art all over Europe.
An agreement was reached, and Gerður prepared the mural for installation at the workshop of the brothers, who then oversaw the installation on the Customs House.
All the work was exceptionally well carried out, both by Gerður Helgadóttir and the Oidtmann Brothers, says the summary.
The mural has been able to withstand the harsh Icelandic climate ever since.
It took Gerður about two years to complete her mural, which was prepared and installed in the years 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after completing her Customs House mural, only 47-years old.
