Voting on the collective wage agreement concludes and Icelandair presents its second quarter results tomorrow
Voting by airline hostesses on their new collective wage agreement concludes at noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's second quarter results will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary operating results indicate that the company's revenues have decreased by 85 percent from the corresponding period last year.
Online voting on the collective wage agreement regarding Icelandair between the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association and the Confederation of Icelandic Employers began on Wednesday, 22 July, and concludes tomorrow, on Monday, 27 July, at 12 o'clock noon.
Icelandair employees who pay membership dues to the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association are eligible to vote on the agreement.
Icelandair and the ICCA signed a new collective wage agreement in the early hours of Sunday, 19 July, but on the previous Friday, Icelandair ended its negotiations with the union after the airline hostesses had overwhelmingly rejected the first agreement in a vote in early July.
By then, Icelandair had dismissed all of the company's airline hostesses and flight attendants but withdrew the dismissals when the new collective wage agreement was signed.
According to the collective wage agreement, airline hostesses have to fly five more hours per month for the same base pay.
The collective wage agreement, which will remain in force until 2025, integrates the provisions for pilots and airline hostesses on the maximum number of flight hours per shift.
The agreement was presented to ICCA members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel on Monday, where many airline hostesses interviewed by the news agency expressed their dissatisfaction with the agreement.
However, most seemed to agree that the agreement must be accepted in order to keep the ICCA alive.
Icelandair's second quarter results will be presented tomorrow, but according to preliminary operating results, the company's EBIT, its earnings before interest and taxes, is negative to the tune of USD 100-110 million, or about ISK 15 billion.
Last Wednesday, Icelandair sent preliminary calculations to the Nasdaq Iceland, stating that the company's revenue during the quarter amounted to approximately USD 60 million, or about ISK 8.3 billion.
Cash and cash equivalents stood at approximately USD 154 million at the end of the quarter, or about ISK 21 billion.
Icelandair also aims for an offering of the company's shares in August.
Icelandair aims to conclude agreements with fifteen creditors, government authorities and aerospace manufacturer Boeing by the end of the month, before its share offering.
