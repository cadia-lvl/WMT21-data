40% of COVID-19 fatalities had type 2 diabetes
Devon Brumfield could hear through the phone how difficult it was for her father to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes so she urged him to seek medical care.
The next day he was dead.
His death was traced to acute respiratory distress from coronavirus infection.
His death certificate noted diabetes as an underlying condition and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified of meeting the same fate.
According to Reuters, Brumfield's fear is not unfounded.
Figures from a new study commissioned by the US government show that nearly 40% of those who have died had type 2 diabetes as an underlying condition.
When looking at those who had not reached the age of 65, the proportion increases to half.
The study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) extended to over 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus during the period between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an epidemiologist with the CDC, said that the findings were striking, not least for those who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and their loved ones.
Was a slow-moving pandemic Reuters commissioned a survey where the answers from the 12 states that responded indicate a similar rate.
10 states, including California, Arizona and Columbia, have not yet began reporting underlying conditions.
"Diabetes was already a slow-moving pandemic.
Now COVID-19 has crashed through like a powerful wave," said Elbert Huang, director of the University of Chicago's Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy, to Reuters.
Diabetes is more common among Blacks and Latinos, who have also suffered more from the coronavirus.
One of the best defences for those who have type 2 diabetes is to keep the disease under control with exercise, a healthy diet and the assistance of healthcare workers.
However, the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult for many to maintain a routine.
The high price of insulin has also forced some people to keep showing up for work, thereby risking virus exposure.
Reuters points out that US authorities should have been aware of the high risk that the virus may pose to type 2 diabetes patients.
During the SARS coronavirus outbreak of 2003, more than 20% of fatalities had the disease, and in the swine flu pandemic of 2009, this group faced triple the risk of hospitalisation.
And when MERS emerged in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care units had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, researcher at Yale University says that because the effects of the COVID-19 virus last longer, the pandemic may unearth a number of previously unknown complications.
"My fear is we will see a tsunami of problems once this is over," said Andrew Boulton, president of the International Diabetes Federation.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus may indirectly lead to a spike in diabetes-related complications, including kidney disease and dialysis.
New studies also indicate that the coronavirus may lead to an increase in cases of diabetes.
According to Reuters, scientists are striving to understand the connections between the coronavirus and type 2 diabetes.
The virus targets the heart, lung and kidneys, organs already weakened in many diabetes patients.
High glucose and lipid counts in diabetes patients can also trigger a so-called "cytokine storm," when the immune system overreacts, attacking the body.
Furthermore, damaged endothelial cells can lead to inflammation, which in turn may cause a lethal blood clot.
"It's all one big puzzle," says Dela Cruz.
"It's all interrelated."
