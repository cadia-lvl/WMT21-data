Screaming at the world
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland is considered to have gone off to a good start, and screaming and yelling in nature is beginning to pull in people all over the world.
"You're right, I need Iceland," says a woman somewhere in the world in the comments for an advertisement from the Looks Like You Need Iceland marketing campaign on YouTube.
Another viewer says they will keep Iceland in their heart for all eternity, and a young woman says she literally has to get to Iceland as soon as possible as her fiancé resides there.
Unfortunately, she's in the United States so she expects to have to wait for another few months.
Yet another viewer asks whether the walking route to Iceland is clear, because there are no aeroplanes.
It is left unsaid whether this person is from another time zone.
Egill Þórðarson at the advertising agency Peel, who was involved in making the advertisements along with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says that the response has exceeded all expectations.
"I was involved in many Inspired by Iceland campaigns that have been very successful but this new campaign is already breaking records.
This basically revolves around creating PR value, that is to get foreign media to cover the campaign, and that has been incredibly successful.
In a relatively short time, we have received coverage in about 700 media outlets all over the world, with a combined audience of over two billion.
The value of this coverage is estimated at ISK 1.8 billion.
That's not too bad."
The main market is usually the United States, and the campaign has been very successful there, although Americans are not coming to the country anytime soon.
According to Egill, well-known market areas like Denmark, the UK and Germany have also been responsive, as well as Russia, which is a pleasant surprise.
There has also been a response from remote areas, such as India, which was not a particular objective.
"These advertisements have travelled further than we expected," says Egill, and it may be pointed out that over four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
"We couldn't have wished for a better start."
The photographs in this spread were taken by Árni Sæberg, photographer for Morgunblaðið, during the shooting of the "Let It Out" advertisements in the middle of last month.
Shooting took place in various locations, including on Skólavörðustígur in Reykjavik, at Reynisfjara, Skógarfoss waterfall, on Sólheimajökull glacier and in a cave by Hjörleifshöfði.
Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson at Skoti productions directed and Óttar Guðnason was the cameraman.
Actors in these shoots were Anna Jia from Iceland and Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary.
Tens of Icelanders were involved in making the advertisements, and while shooting was taking place in South Iceland, another crew was working in West Iceland and the Westfjords.
According to Egill, "Let It Out" is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, with a winter campaign being planned in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
"This is only the first phase in this work for Promote Iceland," says Egill, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has gone extremely well.
"It's great working with them.
It's very important in projects like this to have foreign partners who are knowledgable about the markets we're addressing."
