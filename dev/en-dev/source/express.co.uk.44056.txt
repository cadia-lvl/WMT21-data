Prince Harry news: Duke of Sussex's friend lashes out at explosive claims in new book
Mr Stott told Sky News that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle that the content within the book was no different to that in tabloids other than it was in a hardback.
The former soldier called for more focus on the good the couple do including their charity work.
Mr Stott said: "I think what we are reading here is no different from what we have read in the tabloids it is now just on a hardback."
"You have got an author's persona, it is still not guaranteed that it has come from them."
"I just think it is another sort of attack like the tabloids trying to persecute them."
"I understand they are in the public eye and people wish to know what they are doing but I wish the focus was more on the good that they do and the charity work rather than their intimate privacies."
"But because of who they are they will never get away from that of course."
On Saturday a royal historian also stated that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex supporting the Queen "overshadowed" other members of the Royal Family.
Dr Kate Williams told Sky News that the Royal Family were unable to harness Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's star power.
The royal commentator added that the Royal Family has a strict hierarchy but that public interest cannot be directed or controlled.
She continued: "The fact is that whatever they did to support the Queen would often overshadow other members of the Royal Family and that was seen as a problem."
"They have this huge star power."
"They had a small wedding than most siblings in the same position, Andrew had a huge wedding, Anne had a huge wedding."
"They had a small wedding but still the coverage of Harry and Meghan's wedding even though it was smaller was still as big as William's and Kate's because there is a worldwide fascination with them."
