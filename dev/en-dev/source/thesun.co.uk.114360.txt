Ex-royal couple 'felt snubbed' in Queen's Christmas speech, new book claims
MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry "felt snubbed" by his grandmother, The Queen, during her Christmas speech.
The couple's new biography, Finding Freedom, claims they felt left out of the photo collection on show in the festive address.
Pictures on the desk that The Queen was sitting at included Prince William, Kate Middleton and their three children, Prince Charles and his wife Camilla along with Prince Philip.
Yet, Meghan and Harry were nowhere to be seen having welcomed Archie last May - although the youngster did get a mention as Her Majesty's 'eighth great-grandchild'.
The new book - which is set to be released in August - also reveals that Meghan and Kate Middleton "were never friends" as they "struggled to move past distant politeness" and they only met up on a few occasions.
It was claimed yesterday that Prince Harry's split with his brother William started years before his romance with Meghan - and that it came to a head over William's marriage to Kate Middleton.
The Duke of Sussex felt like a "spare part" at events with his brother and Kate Middleton - with it claimed, "long before Meghan he wanted to change things."
