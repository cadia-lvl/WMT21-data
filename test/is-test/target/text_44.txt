Cooking is a kind of meditation - see Elísa Viðars' menu
Elísa Viðarsdóttir is an elite footballer who plays with Valur.
She is also an MA student of nutritional science, a mother and working as a food scientist.
She needs plenty of energy for her day-to-day life and she usually gives herself time to cook good, healthy food.
"A normal day for me begins when I arrive at work at just over eight," says Elísa.
"After work, I go to the store so I can prepare dinner before picking up my girl from preschool at about three o'clock."
Elísa finds it very nourishing to pick her daughter up early from preschool.
"It's good to have some time with her before I go to practice in the afternoon.
After practice, it's good to come home and only have to heat up the food.
In the evenings, when our girl has gone to sleep, we like to watch one episode to clear the mind."
Elísa does not adhere to any particular diet.
She's about to complete her Master's thesis in nutritional science so she's well aware of what is suitable for her to eat in order to have enough energy to tend to her work, studies, family and practice schedule.
"It suits me to eat varied food that has a good combination of proteins, carbohydrates and fat.
But most important for me is to have a healthy relationship with food and not categorise food as being either bad or good, but rather as having much or little nutritional value.
The thing is that it's OK to eat everything, just not all at once and not all the time.
Elísa is very interested in cooking.
"I find that there is a kind of meditation in standing and cooking in the kitchen so I try to do it often.
I have to admit that I have confidence on my side in the kitchen and I sincerely believe that I'm an excellent cook."
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hempseeds, a little lemon juice, soaked in almond milk overnight.
Then I top the meal off with what I have at each time.
Usually it's a banana and crispy muesli & COFFEE.
I'm a great coffee enthusiast.
Between meals: It varies incredibly, but fruits or vegetables, rye flatbread, plain skyr with banana and muesli, bread with toppings, and then I could eat hummus with a spoon straight from the box if necessary.
Lunch: I often make all kinds of rich salads from what's in the refrigerator; quinoa or barley, falafel, rocket and oven-baked vegetables with a tasty dressing are some of the things I'm working with.
If the schedule becomes completely unravelled (which happens frequently), the egg boiler at work has quite often saved me, and then it's 2 pieces of bread with butter, cheese and boiled egg, and Bob's your uncle.
Between meals: I'll get something rich in carbohydrates before practice, bread with toppings, breakfast cereal or fruits.
Dinner: Fish is very often the choice in my household, or else some delicious vegetable dishes.
