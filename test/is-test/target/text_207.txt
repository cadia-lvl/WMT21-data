Possible to stay in Monet's house over the bank holiday weekend
The house where Impressionist painter Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his life is now available to rent on the Airbnb website.
The next available nights in the house are during the Bank Holiday Weekend.
This small and charming house is located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The world-famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two living rooms and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
Those who intend to rent the house must rent it for at least two nights.
According to the Airbnb site, the house will be next available in a week, on the Sunday of the Bank Holiday Weekend, so it might be ideal for any tradesmen on holiday to book the painter's house.
The two nights over the Bank Holiday Weekend only cost USD 964, or just over ISK 130 thousand, according to Fréttablaðið's estimation.
