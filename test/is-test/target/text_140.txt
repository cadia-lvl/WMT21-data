Registration error prevented return hygiene measures
An error in the registration form that people fill out when coming to the country resulted in an individual residing in this country not being called for testing again.
It is not a requirement to record an identification number if the form is filled out in English, like it is when it is done in Icelandic.
"We will look into it this week," says an expert at the Directorate of Health's Disease Prevention Department.
Three domestic infections were diagnosed at the virology department of Landspítali hospital yesterday.
One of those who turned out to be positive came to the country on 15 July, two days after the rules on the so-called return hygiene measures entered into force.
According to them, those who reside in Iceland are screened upon arrival in the country and called for a second test four or five days later.
But according to RÚV's news at noon, the person in question followed the old system.
The test at the border was negative and he was not called for another screening for the virus.
In an interview with the news agency, Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, expert at the Directorate of Health's Disease Prevention Department, said that this could be traced to an error in the electronic registration form.
If people fill out the registration form in English, they are not required to enter their registration number, as is the case in the Icelandic version.
As a matter of fact, this was mainly intended for foreign tourists.
That is why the person in question did not receive an automatic summon to be tested.
Kamilla says that despite this, many people observed the rules on return hygiene measures despite filling out the registration form in English and in some instances, employers have also taken care to send people to be tested after their arrival in the country.
"This week, we will look into how this can be made more accessible for people, how to make them aware of the process."
The man is in isolation and six have been quarantined.
They will all be tested but two had become symptomatic.
The three infections diagnosed yesterday are currently being traced, but tracing on the two infections reported on Friday has mostly been completed.
In both instances, sequence analysis by deCode Genetics revealed a coronavirus strain not found before in this country.
In one instance, there are reasons to suspect Israel, although it is known that the one who brought the virus to the country also travelled to other European countries.
Kamilla says that it should be clear tomorrow from where the other virus is coming.
A total of 15 people are now in isolation according to the website COVID.is.
135 are in quarantine.
