Women better suited to lead the changes
She said that the new constitution was the biggest step that the nation could take towards more distribution of power, transparency and working to combat corruption and further the interests of the whole of society.
"We must shift gears soon and who's better suited to lead such changes than the group in society that finds it easier to be part of these values.
That's women," said Helga.
"Icelandic women are famous for their female solidarity.
For being united and leading changes together.
So now it's simply our turn to lead these changes."
She says that she's a little worried about the focus on Iceland being "best in the world", both in gender equality and human rights.
"That makes us less prepared to examine what must be done.
Like Germans are very aware of their history and examine everything that must be done.
That's a lot.
We must know where we're coming from, know the history and listen.
Listen to the voices of marginalised groups.
We don't all live by the same rules here," said Helga.
When asked, she said that women were in many ways well off in Iceland, but added that like in many other places, values in Iceland are incredibly male-centric.
She said that politics, for example, revolve around private interests, domination and power, which are the forces that maintain inequality in all societies.
"Women have now formed this group and joined together, and they are just getting a little annoyed with the Parliament repeatedly intending to disregard this referendum in 2012," she said.
"We are basing this on these female-centric values.
On the basis of human rights and nature conservation, cooperation and us actually all being in the same boat," she said, adding that the aforementioned values were the basic values of the new constitution.
"We are a country that is very rich in natural resources and it's ridiculous that there are people living in poverty here.
It's ridiculous, we can divide things differently," said Helga.
"The notion of lower wages for women's jobs being some kind of a law of nature is ridiculous.
It's ridiculous for airline hostesses and nurses constantly having to fight for better wages just to be able to earn a decent living."
